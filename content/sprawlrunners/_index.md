[Sprawlrunners](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/334278/Sprawlrunners?affiliate_id=313188) is a cyberpunk-with-magic setting-agnostic ruleset for [Savage Worlds](https://www.peginc.com/product-category/savage-worlds/). 

After a few years of battling the Shadowrun rules, my table eventually threw in the towel and ported our in-progress campaign to Sprawlrunners. So far, we've been really happy with this decision.
