## Weapon changes

Almost all of this are stock SprawlRunners & SWADE; gathered here for quick reference.

### Modifications

These are intrinsic to the weapon when it is purchased. Below are the standard Sprawlrunners ones:

* Automatic pistol (1LP, RoF 2)
* Burst fire mode (SMG/AR) (1LP)
* Compact frame (1LP, -25% shots, -2 penalty to Notice)
* Foldable stock (1LP, -1 penalty to Notice when folded, 1 Action to deploy)
* Reinforced frame (1LP, flechette pistol can fire slugs)

And some houseruled additions:

* Revolver: reduced shots (already reflected in statline). If it is a smartgun, character can load different ammo types in different cylinders, and choose which cylinders to fire for each attack via a mental command as a free action.
* Heavy calibre: applies +1 AP. Costs +1LP.

### Accessories

These can be added/removed from the weapon.

* Bipod (1LP, negate recoil/min Str penalty, takes action to deploy)
* Gas vent system (1LP, -1 recoil penalty)
* Gyro-mount harness (3LP, remove recoil or unstable platform penalty)
* Laser sight (1LP) (+1 bonus at short range)
* Scope (1LP, +1LP for low light/thermal, cancel 2 additional penalty points when Aiming)
* Smartgun (1LP)
* Suppressor (1LP, -2 to Notice)

### Ammo types

* APDS (1LP, +1 AP)
* Ex-Ex (1LP, +1 damage, can cook off)
* Gel rounds (1LP, set AP to 0, non-lethal damage)

### Cosmetic trappings

* *Imposing* - oversized; bulky; threatening.
* *Blinged* - made of mirror-polished chrome; AR broadcast of a killcount holo.
* *Sleek* - matte black; no protrusions; looks efficient.
* *Sci-fi* - weird shapes; sculpted to look bio-organic; covered in neon lights.
