## Components of the smartgun system 

Smartgun systems are made up of two components. 


### Smartgun adapter 

Smartguns require a sensor package to be fitted to the weapon, and accurately calibrated to the specific weapon’s characters (similar to dialling in an optical sight.)

Weapons that lack an integral adapter can be retrofitted. This takes the form of a few smallish boxes mounted under the barrel and somewhere on the frame of the gun. These contain LIDAR, time-of-flight range finder, optical and thermal imaging, and other sensors. A ballistics co-processor stores the calibration data for the firearm’s behaviour. 

Weapons with integral adapters often include additional sensors and tracking, such as discharge count, barrel temperature, and internal stresses. These help track long term maintenance of the weapon, improvi reliability.
