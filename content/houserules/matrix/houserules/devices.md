## Icons

Every Matrix-enabled device - and in the Sixth World, that's a lot - is represented in the Matrix by an icon.

Some of these are *persona devices*: those that can let you get onto the Matrix and form a persona so you can interact with it. Examples include commlinks, cyberdecks, and RCCs. 

## Commlinks

Commlinks are the everyday Matrix devices of the masses.

## Cyberdecks

Stats are unchanged from RAW; Cyberdecks have an attribute array that can be allocated across the four Matrix stats. Takes a Free action to swap any two stats. Remember you can only do one Free action per turn. If you want to do more reconfiguring than that, you can use Matrix Simple Actions.

Cyberdecks are reduced in price to 25% of RAW. See [the gear houserules]({{< relref "electronics.md#cyberdecks" >}}) for more information and statblocks.

## Personas

When you sign into the Matrix via a commlink, cyberdeck, or RCC, the device gets a special icon called a persona. Personas are your own personal digital mirror image. Persona's appearances are often very elaborately customised, particularly by wankers. 

You cannot steal anyone else's persona, nor can you have two personas at once. ([More on why here]({{< relref "legal_matrix.md#personas-your-commlink-as-the-keys-to-your-life" >}}).)

## Programs

*Maybe* 

* decrease to ((Deck Rating) / 2) slots?
* add a few more impactful ones?
* add a one-shot +2 dice boosts that burn out after use? (like trinkets) (deckers craft these with Software in downtime?)

### Hacking programs

* **Chaff**: any attempt to Trace Icon against the persona will be inaccurate by (1d6 * 10) metres; if the direction matters, use the scatter rules. This also applies to the tracing that happens after convergence from GOD. (Replaces Cry Wolf.)

## Agents

* Deck can only run agents of a rating equal to or less than the deck rating.
* Agent stats are equal to the deck rating and deck's ASDF, agent skills are equal to its rating. Hence agents are typically rolling ((agent rating) + (deck rating)) as a dice pool.
* If used to assist the decker on an action, it takes a Simple Action to order the agent to help. Then it rolls its dice pool as a teamwork test.
* Agents running the same task repeatedly (eg Matrix perception) are subject to the same -1 penalty per repeated attempt as any other character. Additionally, this will typically be resolved by buying hits.
