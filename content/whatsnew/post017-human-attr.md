Change [human racial traits]({{< relref "races.md" >}}) to remove the "free extra Bennie" trait and replace it with "one free attribute starts at d6" trait instead. (I have stolen this from Savage Worlds Pathfinder, and it seems as reasonble a way to make humans at +4 racial bonus as any other option.)
