## Manufactured materials

### Bioplastics

Although fossil fuel extraction has long since faded in the Sixth World, plastics are still common and cheap due to production techniques that harvest biobased polymers from renewable sources such as bio-engineered microorganisms. They behave similarly to current-day plastics, and span a wide range of applications from glass-like polycarbonate, thin films used for packaging, and harder plastics used for household objects.

## Natural materials

### Leather

The emergence of various Awakened species has, naturally, led to them being killed for their hides, with a value roughly approximate to how dangerous the animal in question is to hunt. Basilisk, cockatrice, afanc, and deathrattle leather is particularly prized amongst those looking for the perfect material for their status symbol personal vehicles.

Meanwhile, decline in animal farming means cow leather has become significantly more expensive. Almost all the "leather" jackets most wageslaves or SINless can afford are actually synthetic. 

Fakes also abound. According to market research, the amount of "dragon leather" goods on sale in any major city at any given time vastly exceeds the total amount of dragon hide in the world, including all the great Dragons.

### Wood

Although the Awakening did much to rekindle life in north America's greatest forests, it also made those forests highly dangerous places, teeming with hostile wildlife - magical and otherwise. Consequently, the price of wood as a building material has increased sharply.

The only kinds of wood ever used in lower- or middle-class homes is pressed particleboard as a cheap building material; even that is uncommon. Upper-middle-class wageslaves might have engineered wood floors or walls made from quick-grown farmed breeds like bamboo or fir. Only the richest wageslaves can hope to own anything made of hardwoods, either manufactured new or antiques. Naturally these are now potent status symbols.


## Exotic materials

## Nanofabrication

Nanofabricated materials can exhibit tremendous mechanical properties, including immense tensile and compressive strength. Although these materials are very expensive, this makes them highly desirable in advanced building construction (eg supertall buildings and arcologies) and other exotic projects (eg. the platform-to-Earth tether for the Skyook space elevator.)
