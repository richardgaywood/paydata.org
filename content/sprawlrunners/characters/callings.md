## Types of calling

* THRILLSEEKER - you want a loud and carefree life; you value living fast and don't care if you die young.
* PINK MOHAWK - you want to impede the corps and help the little guys.
* BLACK TRENCHCOAT - you value professionalism, planning, patience, honouring your word, and vengeance against those who doublecross you.
* TRUTHSEEKER - value forbidden knowledge, exposing dark secrets, uncovering corruption - but to who's benefit?

* ...more?...

## Appendix - Rough notes



My current thinking:

1) Define a set of possible (broad) reasons why someone might be a Sprawlrunner. Initial ideas:

* THRILLSEEKER - desire to live a loud and carefree life; live fast and die young
* PINK MOHAWK - desire to impede the corps and helping the little guys
* BLACK TRENCHCOAT - value professionalism, planning, patience, honouring your word, vengeance
* TRUTHTELLER - value exposing dark secrets, rooting out corruption
* ...more?...

2) Each calling has a list of "story beats" (writing these is the hard bit!)

2a) You can tell the GM a beat that interests you most, and they'll try and incorporate it into the plotline. You can also ask the other PCs to suggest a beat for your character - I see this as a powerful way to invest other players in your character's personal story!

3) When you achieve a beat, you get Conviction, and tick it off.

3a) (maybe) if you do a beat for a second time, you can get a Bennie, but not Conviction.
3b) (maybe) if you do a beat while you already have Conviction, you can get a Bennie and you don't need to tick it off

A more radical version of this is to have minor/major beats (like Heart), and for each minor beat to grant an advance, and each major beat to increase your rank. I don't want to move that far from SWADE.

A lot here rests on the lists of beats per calling. But I keep coming back to this idea. It feels good, I think. Thoughts?

(Note that each calling is entirely orthogonal and detached from character archetypes like mage, streetsam, rigger, ...)
