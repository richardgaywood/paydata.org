## What is a magical tradition?

When magic returned to the world, people found that certain ...

## Overview of rules structure

Each tradition gets:

* Signature power(s): _these are somehow improved_
* Removed power(s): powers the given tradition cannot use.
* Spirit types: the types of spirit they can summon  

## Disallowed powers

All powers in SWADE (pgs 154--171) are allowed, *except* the following:

* Drain Power Points - meaningless in a game that doesn't use power points.
* Object Reading - folded into assensing and the Astral skill.
* Burrow, Divination, Intangibility, Resurrection, Teleport, Zombie - contradict core Shadowrun canon and/or are a bit of an "I win!" button.
* Mind Control, Puppet, Mind Reading (_more?_)- only available to certain mages.

## The Magic skill

For simplicity, I am going to use just one skill for all the traditions and call it "Magic". If you prefer a more SWADE-y approach, you can rename it on a per-tradition basis, eg. using Faith for the divinity-derived ones.

There are two variants of the Magic skill: one based on Spirit and one based on Smarts. Different traditions use different variants.

### Hermeticism

Hermetic mages are the stereotypical "magic as a science". xxx

Their Magic skill is based on Smarts.

### Divinity



### Gaia


Sample spirits (from Sprawlrunners): Desert, Swamp  

### Animism

> Animism (from Latin: anima meaning 'breath, spirit, life' is the belief that objects, places, and creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence. 

Animism is distinct from Gaia tradition

Examples of animism include some Native America shamen, Shinto, and many Neo-pagans. 

Sample spirits (from Sprawlrunners): Home, xxx; City, Field; Mountain, Sewer.  

### Chaos
