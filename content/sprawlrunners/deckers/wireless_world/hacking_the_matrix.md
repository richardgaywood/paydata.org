## The end of encryption

The incorporation of early quantum processors into the first cyberdecks sent an earthquake through the tech world from which it never recovered. Even the strongest, best designed encryption of the day fell before it in fractions of a second. There could be no more secrets. 

Today, things have improved only slightly; the most advanced encryption in the world still cannot hold up to sustained assault from a skilled hacker with high-end cyberdeck.

This single innovation has reshaped the world.

## Rise of the spiders

Faced with the total loss of passive defence - ie. strong encryption of data - the megacorps had to pivot to active defence. 

First, they built high walls around their kingdoms. Some of the most sophisticated pseudo-AI on the planet exists to run ICE: Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics. ICE patrols and defends the megacorp's hosts tirelessly, rooting out invading hackers and - sometimes - frying their brains.

But ICE isn't all-powerful, so the corps also set people to guard those walls. These counter-hackers, called *spiders* in the language of the street, sit in the middle of webs of sensors and alarms. Attract their attention, and they are swiftly dispatched to deal with you. And they are *good*, with all the equipment and training of their deep-pocketed masters.

## The Grid Overwatch Division (GOD)

Each megacorp can hire its own security staff to patrol its own hosts, but that leaves the backbone itself vulnerable to attacks. It's too important to leave undefended, so the Corporate Court formed the Grid Overwatch Division (GOD). GOD is a semi-autonomous organisation, tasked with defending public grid infrastructure, staffed by deckers and technicians loaned from the AA and AAA megacorps.

## How to hack

### Hacking on the local mesh

On the local mesh, even a novice decker with a Saturday night special 'deck reigns supreme. Vending machines, security cameras, commlinks, door locks - few will cause a decker to even break stride.



### Hacking local hosts and WANs

### Hacking uplink and cloud hosts

You don't. Not unless you're faster than Fastjack, and even then, it's still a suicide mission, *omae*.

See, everything on the backbone - everything from the uplink host inwards - is GOD's dominion. And GOD are tough, fast, supremely well-trained, and ruthless. Most deckers survive by flying under their radar and never going toe-to-toe with them -- so you stay off their turf.
