## Banish

*(NB: slightly changed from RAW.)*

{{% pageinfo %}}
Rank: Seasoned *(changed from Veteran in RAW)*\
Power Points: See below \
Range: LoS \
Duration: Instant 

Forces other summoned spirits back to the metaplanes. Opposed roll of caster's Conjuration skill versus the target spirit's Spirit. Success leaves the spirit Shaken; each raise inflicts a Wound. If the spirit is incapacitated, it is dismissed from service and returned to the metaplanes.

If the spirit is a companion (see Sprawlrunners pg 17), then it gets to roll the summoner's Spirit in addition to its own (choosing the highest dice, as usual.) Additionally, if incapacitated, it will not be permanently banished, but will return to the summoner's side after 1d4 days.

The power point cost, and hence roll penalty, is determined by the target spirit's rank, similarly to when it is summoned. Hence:

* Servant/Watcher: no modifier to roll
* Seasoned rank (lesser spirit): -2 to roll (4PP)
* Veteran rank (common spirit): -3 to roll (6PP)
* Heroic rank (greater spirit): -4 to roll (8PP)

## New Minor Forms

{{% pageinfo %}}
Rank: Seasoned

Every time the summoner learns this power, they may create two new minor form spirits for any greatforms they know. The two new minor forms do not need to be for the same greatform.

Summoners may take this power multiple times.

## Summon Ally (*Specific Greatform*)

{{% pageinfo %}}
Rank: Novice \
Power Points: See below \
Range: Smarts \
Duration: Instant 

Summons a spirit from the metaplanes to do the summoner's bidding. See [Summoning]({{< relref "summoning.md" >}}) for rules.

Each time the character takes the Summon Ally power, they can choose a new greatform of spirit they can summon, from the following list: fire; earth; air; water; beasts; man. When summoned, the spirit will take whatever minor form the summoner desires. See [Greatforms And Minor Forms]({{< relref "greatforms_and_minor_forms.md" >}}) for more information.

The power point cost, and hence roll penalty, is determined by the target spirit's rank, similarly to when it is summoned. Hence:

* Servant/Watcher: no modifier to roll
* Seasoned rank (lesser spirit): -2 to roll (4PP)
* Veteran rank (common spirit): -3 to roll (6PP)
* Heroic rank (greater spirit): -4 to roll (8PP)
