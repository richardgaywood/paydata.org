Add some [setting notes clarifying what a "modern" firearm is]({{< relref "firearms_and_the_matrix.md" >}}), in the context of our campaign. Also defined rules for "throwback" guns - ones that have no on-board processing at all, so are unhackable and undetectable on the Matrix, but cost more to acquire and cannot use some accessories.
