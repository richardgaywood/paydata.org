## Disallowed powers

All powers in SWADE (pgs 154--171) are allowed as part of the Spellcaster arcane background, *except* the following:

* Banish, Summon Ally - these are included in the Summoner arcane background.
* Drain Power Points - meaningless in a game that doesn't use power points.
* Burrow, Divination, Intangibility, Resurrection, Teleport, Zombie - contradict core Shadowrun canon.

## Notes/clarifications about specific powers

### Arcane Protection

Note that this overlaps somewhat with the Shielding edge (see Sprawlrunners, pg 17). I won't stop you taking Arcane Protection, but the edge is arguably more powerful and useful.

### Healing

Healing cannot be used to heal Wounds caused by drain.

### Illusion

By default, Illusions are mana-based; they only appear within the minds of living creatures. Purely technological systems like cameras or drone sensors see nothing. (Living characters with cybernetic senses like cybereyes still see the illusion, however.)

The Strong modifier (+2PP) instead produces a physical illusion, which does affect technological systems.

### Relief

Relief cannot be used to heal Fatigue caused by drain.
