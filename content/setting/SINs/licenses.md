### Things that need licenses (in the UCAS and many other legal territories)

- civilian-grade firearms of all kinds
- melee weapons that aren't plausibly tools, including swords, long knives, some axes 
- certain kinds of cyberware, including (but not limited to) cyberclaws
- magical abilities
- cyberdecks -- defined as VR/AR devices fitted with hardware decryption engines <!-- TODO -->    
- military-grade firearms: implanted weaponry, APDS ammo, assault rifles with full-auto, machine guns, explosives, very high-calibre rifles, etc


### Open vs concealed carry

"Open" carry means the presence of the license is broadcast in the clear alongside the person's SIN broadcast <!-- TODO -->. Anyone with matrix access (AR or just via a commlink) can read this. Many people have their AR overlays configured to automatically flag people with open carry licenses of any kind.

"Concealed" carry means the person is legally allowed to possess the restricted item/ability, but does not have to broadcast the licence at all times. This state can only be read with a high level of access to the global SIN database. <!-- TODO --> 

Low grade fake hacked/cloned licences purchased by PCs for Logistic Points are always open carry ones. Concealed carry licences are very tightly controlled, rigorously checked, and cost considerably more to acquire on the shadow market.


<!-- from firearms_and_the_matrix.md
If you have a [normal open-carry firearms licence]({{< relref "sins_and_licences.md" >}}), then you are required to have a broadcasting tag on your gun at all times. This tells everyone who cares to know that you are armed.

If you have a concealed carry licence, you are legally permitted to disable this broadcast. Criminals routinely do this on their guns, too, for obvious reasons. 

If a cop or a guard spots a gun poking out of your clothes and you *don't* have a squealer tag running, they are going to be intensely curious about you. For this reason, even criminals sometimes turn gun broadcasts on - it can, paradoxically, help you blend in better.

### Consequences of getting caught

If law enforcement notice a person who is visibly carrying weapons, has magical ability (via assensing), or has other restricted items _and_ who is not broadcasting a licence _then_  they will most likely check for a concealed carry licence. If that doesn't exist, they will probably assume they are hostile and take immediate punitive actions.
