## Access levels

Your persona can have three different access levels to stuff on the Matrix:

* **Guest**: the default permission level for persons that are unknown. Sometimes this means you can't access anything, sometimes it means you can go inside a host and interact with some of it. Depends on the host.
* **User**: a normal user's access rights. Can usually read/write files, give standard commands to attached devices.
* **Admin**: full control, can order devices to do anything they reasonably can perform.

These access levels apply to an entire PAN or WAN at once. If you have User access to a PAN, you have User access to every device connected to that PAN.
