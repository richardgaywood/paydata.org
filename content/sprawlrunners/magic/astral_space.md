## Astral space

Sprawlrunners RAW does not use astral projection and significantly linits astral perception.

As a houserule, I will allow astral projection in my campaign.

unarmed combat does Spirit damage



Astral Projection
Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 0 
Range: Self
 Duration: 2 hours
Trappings: Projecting your soul 
You project your essence into the Astral Plane.  The Ghostly world of Spirits that overlaps our plane and is in some ways a reverse mirror of it, so that the people and places that dominate our reality fade to dim shadows, and the shape of magic and life that may be vague impressions jump to startlingly colorful life. While Astrally Projected your meat body is incapacitated.  Your astral form is invisible and intangible to people in the meat world. Your astral form can fly at Pace 24 and may “run” for 2d6″ of additional movement..  Your Astral form does not have access to any of your gear but does have Astral copies of all Foci you are bonded to.

When a Magician or Adept perceive in the Astral Plane they are able to use the Assensing ability and also see creatures and magic. A Magician or an Adept can also use spells to damage creatures from that plane of existence (for half damage). All stats go off of physical abilities as on the character sheet. For a Magician to fully interact with the Astral Plane he must leave his body and project his essence there. While on the Astral Plane any spell cast on a creature there does full damage. Things on the Astral Plane happens faster than in the real world, so if combat is split between the Astral Plane and the physical world, resolve what happens on the Astral Plane in a combat round before the physical plane.
While on the Astral Plane treat a Magician’s Mental Attributes as one higher than on the character sheet (this goes for Critters as well). Ignore physical attributes. For resisiting damage directed at the Magician or for critters follow this:
Agility- Use Smarts; Strength and Vigor- Use Spirit.

A Magician’s physical body is helpless while he is on the Astral Plane and can be dispatched easily, so be careful. If a Magician dies on the Astral Plane, his body dies as well. If a Magician’s body is killed while he is on the Astral Plane his essence is trapped and eventually he’ll go insane and become a ghost, wraith, or other type of nasty Astral critter. A Magician can remain in control of myself for the duration of normally being able to be in the Astral Plane. He can also manifest as a spirit on the physical plane during this time and cause havoc or revenge during that time. He can cast spells (still suffers drain) and interact with people during this time.
If a Magician feels damage to his body (and isn’t killed) he can immediately return to his body as a Standard Action. If he is engaged in an activity/combat he must make a Spirit Test TN of 6 to successfully pull his consciousness back into his body.
