Scenario: you and your RPG group want to play Shadowrun. You've never played before; maybe you have experience of other RPGs, maybe you don't. You're intrigued by the *man-meets-magic-and-machine* setting but you've read some stuff about the game system. It sounds... daunting. Maybe you've gotten as far as looking through the rulebook, and thought: *eep!*

If this is you, I hope to help!

Shadowrun is a pretty tricky beast at first -- but (I swear!) it does start to make a degree of sense once you get started. This document presents a grab-bag of tips and suggestions that might help you get past that initial barrier.

Note that this document was written specifically for Shadowrun Fifth Edition (5e), although much of the more generic advice applies to other editions also.

## Things to immediately dispense with

There's a few obvious things that you and your table can agree not to use that'll make your initial games earlier without leaving any glaring holes in the game:

1. **Set the splatbooks to one side**: The SR core rulebook has plenty of content for all kinds of characters. So make a pact across your table that you'll start off without any of the content from the "splatbooks" (the per-character-type expansion books: Run Faster, Run & Gun, Street Grimoire, Rigger 5.0, etc.) Now, don't get me wrong - there's a lot of richness in there you'll want to use, probably sooner rather than later; this is a just-for-now deal. You can add the content back in as you find you want it.
2. **Leave technomancers out**: You'll all have enough on your hands with The Regular Matrix, let alone The Magical Matrix. Keep them aside for later.
3. **Approach riggers with caution** [^riggers]: it pains me to write this, because I love riggers and I think they're a huge amount of fun. But playing ones involves a huge amount of special rules and even some special core mechanics, so they can be an uphill battle. And they are the least important of the core set of character types. So if you have no strong feelings, maybe avoid them for now. If you do want a rigger at your table, start on the small side with a driver and build up to drone armies.
4. **Aspected magicians** and **mystic adepts**: these character types suffer from some non-obvious problems and it's easy to build under- or over-powered characters with them. Plus, they don't add any flavour to the game that you don't get from having a regular, full mage. Consider them to be an advanced chargen option.

## How to approach character generation

*Oh my god there's so much stuff.*

There is, but there are some things you can do help narrow it down.

You might consider using pregen characters. But pregens suck, and the ones in the rulebook aren't very good (they have some very weird choices and they aren't even rules-legal, which is *incredible*), and dealing with the massive equipment list the pregens have is almost as overwhelming as generating a character. So, maybe skip that, and make your own.

### Chargen methods

First and foremost: use a tool to help you make characters. [Chummer5](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a) is free. Make sure it's configured to use only the core rulebook.

* **Consider using karmagen** - I think new players get tripped up with prioritygen where they run out of points in one category, reshuffle the letters, and now have to re-do a category they already finished because of it. Karmagen is a real chore to do by hand but chummer5 makes it easy.
* Consider **using only skillgroups, not skills** - this is not only easier for players to navigate / attempt to optimise, but is also easier for GMs too when they need to find a skill to roll against for some random check. However, note that this will need a tiny houserule if you're using prioritygen to make skill points and skill group points interchangeable.

### Thinking about characters

Shadowrun is classless, and you can build anything, which is great -- but also overwhelming. How do you get started navigating all this stuff?

* Think about **core archetypes** - most characters will pick a role in the team and specialise in it. Combat, magic, hacking are the most obvious and clear-cut examples.
* What does specialisation mean? This can vary a bit across tables but a good rule of thumb is being able to roll 12-15 dice in a few key skills. (Fewer than 12 and you're probably a little underpowered. Much more than 15 and you're probably over-specialised and may be better off spreading your points around across a broader base of skills.)
	* For a combat character, key skills might be a selection of small/concealable weapons and larger/more dangerous weapons. 
	* For deckers, it's the skills in the Hacking and Software groups. 
	* For magicians, it's spellcasting and summoning. 
* Think about **other roles** - faces (negotiation and social infiltration), physical infiltration and breaking & entering, vehicles, and many, many more. This is where the classless system in Shadowrun really shines. 
	* Some of these other roles naturally pair off with other archetypes. For example, combat characters have high Agility for combat, and B&E skills mostly use Agility. So any combat character can roll good numbers of dice in skills like Lockpicking and Sneaking for a modest number of skillpoints.
* Think about **stuff everyone should be able to do** - you probably want ~6 dice in some basic skills:
	* Firing a weapon, if only as a backup
	* Lying to people (Con skill)
	* Blending in with crowds (Etiquette)

## Some notes on specific rules

Even with the splatbooks left aside, the SR 5e core rulebook (CRB) alone is still pretty large. It's a lot easier to get to grips with if you leave out the less important rules... but the book's organisation isn't great, so it doesn't do a great job of flagging up the rules that you can safely ignore when you're starting out.

In addition, some of the rules are just plain *bad*. Either completely confusing, a pain in the arse to use, or both.

Here I'm going to flag up some sections I suggest you ignore.

### Rules to definitely skip over

I advise you to not even *read* these.

Characters:

* **Addiction** and **Overdosing** - these rules are, famously, completely confusing and don't even work that well once you unpick how they're supposed to be used. Skip. This will make combat drugs over-powered, however, as there'll be no counterbalance to them; later on, you might want to explore some simplified houserules for addicition. Or just ignore the issue if you don't mind it.

Combat:

* **"Blasts in a confined space" / "simultaneous blasts"** - these are sometimes called the "chunky salsa" rules because that's the effect they have on people. They're a pain in the arse to calculate and given how deadly explosives are anyway they only make the difference between being "dead" and being "really, really dead."

Magic: 

* **Background count** - this is a GM-fiat way of subtracting some dice from mages in a way they cannot do anything about. Most people think it's a fairly clumsy and un-fun attempt to balance mages, who are otherwise a bit overpowered. 
* **Initiation and metamagics** - these are down-the-road advancement options for mages. Safe to ignore until you need them.

Matrix:

* **Noise** - it's really just a way of saying "your connection is bad." Ignore the tables to calculate it. If you feel like the fictional situation the characters are in demands some, just make up a number and apply it. [^JerekTelorian]

Vehicles:

* **Sensor targeting** - heck of a lot of dice rolls that add little to the game. Entirely skippable.

### Rules to approach with caution

Combat:

* **Barriers** - the barrier rules (both for destroying structures and for shooting people through the cover they are cowering behind) are a bit fiddly. They work OK, but aren't the fastest thing to play out at the table. I'd suggest keeping them for only when it really matters. If it's a more trivial set of circumstances with a predictable outcome, like car vs. chain link fence or pistol vs armoured bunker, don't bother looking the rule up.
* **Surprise** - there's a throwaway line in the rules that suggests you should roll for surprise quite often, basically anytime one side wasn't fully expecting combat to start. However, failing a surprise check is extremely deadly, so rolling it routinely can result in some weird outcomes. I'd suggest saving the surprise rolls for genuinely unexpected ambushes, and handling most "combat is starting now" by simply rolling for initiative. 
* **Scatter** - the scatter rules only work if you're doing your combat on a grid with tokens or miniatures. If you're running anything theatre-of-the-mind, you'll have to do some handwaving to resolve the scatter roll.
* **Recoil** - recoil accumulates across each character's turns, which is deeply obnoxious to track. It's also reset by the character spending a single action to do anything other than aiming, so it's pretty easy for the character to avoid the penalty anyway. You won't break the game if you just ignore it adding up across turns and only consider it in the context of each individual attack action.

Magic:

* **Enchanting** and **ritual spellcasting** - these both sound cool (because they are cool!) but when you look really hard at the numbers they both turn out to be rather underpowered and consequently dull. If anyone at your table is passionate about them, come back later and houserule to make them more powerful.
* **Summoning** - there's nothing wrong with the rules here, it's just that spirits are very powerful, to the point where they can easily become unbalancing. There's a lot of houserule suggestions around to nerf them but initially I suggest you start out using the rules as written and see how you go. Just be aware of the problem.

Vehicles:

* **Vehicle speeds** - the Shadowrun tables for translating the abstract "speed" stat to actual miles-per-hour are, umm, broken. Don't look too hard at them or things fall apart. If you try really hard, [you can break the world with hilarious consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1nbjhe/xpostshadowrun_everyone_is_dead_san_francisco_is/).
* **Drones** - drone swarms can get very overpowered very quickly. Also, having lots of drones around can really slow down gameplay, as they all get their own initiative roll, have to resolve their actions, etc. Like spirits, this isn't a reason not to have some (they're cool!), just be aware of the issues.

Other stuff:

* **Lock picking** - per the rules, you usually have to roll once to break into the casing of a maglock, then roll again to actually pick it. This is nonsense on stilts. Just roll once.

## GMing

### Fake it till you make it

For all of Shadowrun's voluminous rules, and 80+ skills, and millions of items of gear, and modifiers, and modifiers that modify the modifiers (!), it almost always boils down to the player:

* rolling a skill 
* ...plus an attribute
* ... plus or minus some modifiers
* ...against a threshold.

*As GM, you are well within your rights to make this up on the spot*. Now, whether to do so or not can be a judgement call, with a few factors to weigh:

* Is the character doing something the rules don't cover? If so, you're definitely going to be ad-libbing.
* Is this something the rules cover, but you know the rules are too detailed and fiddly to use right now, perhaps because the player is taking a low-stakes or low-risk action? Then short-cut the rules down to a single roll.
* Is this something the rules cover, but you don't know them well enough to confidently use the full rules? You have a choice here: either pause play to look them up, or handwave them down to a single roll. There's no right answer, it depends on the situation and your table's preferences.

Suppose you want to make a roll up. How do you do that?

* **Picking a skill** - this isn't usually too tricky, because despite Shadowrun having a lot of skills, they're fairly well defined without too much overlap. The social skills can be slightly tricky - the lines between Con and Negotiate and Etiquette can be blurry - so watch out for that. If you're really finding the skill list overwhelming, consider collapsing it down to just the ~25 skill groups.
* **Picking an attribute** - every skill has a linked attribute, which is a fine choice. Sometimes you might want to change it though, and that's perfectly fine. For example, I have made players roll Strength + Unarmed Combat when attempting to grab someone and hold them still.
* **Modifiers** - use these to represent the situation going on. Are things making the character's job harder? Do they have inadequate tools, are they working under time pressure, is the mana field here polluted, is the concealed weapon they are looking for small? Impose -2, -4, or -6. Are they trying to work out where a loud sound came from, or convince a friendly NPC to do something, or search the Matrix for public information? Impose +2, +4, or +6.
* **Threshold** - use this to capture the intrinsic difficulty of the job. Are they picking a poor quality lock? Use a threshold of 1. Are they trying to drive a motorbike through a narrow gap at high speed? Use a threshold of 3.

Note that there's a lot of overlap between modifiers and threshold, particularly when ad-libbing a roll like this. This is true on a statistical level as well, as a modifier of +3 is equivalent to changing the required threshold by -1. 

It's perfectly OK to skip the modifiers and just change the threshold instead. This is particularly true of tests like Perception, where the result is graduated rather than a flat pass/fail. I rarely modify Perception checks, and instead I vary the information the player received based on the outcome of an unmodified roll.

If there really isn't a skill to match, you can also ask for an attribute+attribute roll. There's a few of these defined in core rules, like Judge Intentions (Int+Cha) or Composure (Wil+Cha). 

### Difficulty setting & NPC stats

Character generation is overwhelming when you're doing one; what if you need six NPCs?!

The very short answer is: don't. It's not necessary. 

A real common GM trick is the "rule of threes". If you need a dice roll for an NPC, pick a level:

* If their skill level is **basic**, roll **6 dice**. Examples: wageslaves driving a car, gangers trying to intimidate someone.
* If their skill level is **trained**, roll **9 dice**. Examples: wageslaves doing their job, gangers or mall cops fighting. 
* If their skill level is **skilled**, roll **12 dice**. Examples: standard security guards fighting, bouncers looking for concealed weapons.
* If their skill level is **professional**, roll **15 dice**. Examples: high threat response teams in combat, Mr Johnson lying or negotiating.
* If their skill level is **elite**, roll **18 or more dice**. 

In-game, these dice can come from some combination of attribute, skill, and gear - it doesn't matter which.


## Best splatbook content

I suggested above that you set the splatbook content aside at first, but there's a lot of good stuff in there that you'll want to introduce as you go along. Some suggestions for the most useful expansions:

* **magic traditions from Street Grimoire** - I think these add nice flavour to expand role playing options for mage characters.
* **vehicle mods from Rigger 5.0** - I don't love the rules themselves, but the crunch is all done away from the table, and I think it makes riggers way cooler.
* **the decker actions from Kill Code** - gives deckers a lot more tactical flexibility.

## If RAW is not for you, but you still like the setting

There are [alternative systems](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/fiddqk/big_list_of_shadowrun_alternatives/) if you think you want to go that way. But if your table want to get to grips with the core Shadowrun system, hopefully this document can help.

> I second this comment. Shadowrun has a lot of rules that do not come up very often, and for some reason, not all of them are intuitive. Instead of knowing each specific exception, make sure you know well the basic stuff, like skills, combat mechanics, common infiltration rolls and basic magic and hacking stuff. If a niche case comes up in game, make a quick call that makes sense in the system and move on.... Focus on having fun, cool descriptions and in the characters.
