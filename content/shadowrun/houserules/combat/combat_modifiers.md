## Environmental

Factors effecting: visibility (rain/fog/smoke), light level (darkness/glare), wind

* If there's enough of the factor to affect you: take -4
* If you compensate for the factor via gear: take -2
	* eg. it's dark and you have low-light goggles/glasses
* If you compensate for the factor via innate traits, cyberware, or magic: no penalty
	* eg. it's dark and you're a dwarf with thermographic vision

Penalties stack across categories eg. if it's dark and there's fog it's -8. Compensation does not stack within a category eg. if you have low-light cybereyes plus thermal vision goggles, you take -2.

## Range

Define weapon rages as:

1. Hand - within arm's length
2. Close - a few steps; in the same room
3. Near - a few dozen metres; within the same street
4. Far - maybe a hundred metres; a large field
5. Extreme - further

Take penalties as follows:
