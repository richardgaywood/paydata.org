{{% alert title="Note" %}}
These houserules contain quite a few changes from normal Sprawlrunners. The intent is to enable the addition of more magic traditions beyond hermetic mage and shaman. 
{{% /alert %}} 

RAW Sprawlrunners offers three types of Arcane Background - hermetic mage, shaman, and qi adept (like physical adepts in Shadowrun). 

For my game, I am splitting these up a bit, into the following Arcane Backgrounds:

* Physical / qi adept - the classic Shadowrun physad. Doesn't have an arcane power skill.
* Intuitive spellcaster - magic users like shamans, whose approach to magic works on an artistic, instinctive, or naturalistic level. Arcane power skill is Sorcery (Spirit).
* Logical spellcaster - magic users like hermetic mages, whose approach to magic is more scientific, rigorous, or based on theoretical study. Arcane power skill is Sorcery (Smarts).
* Summoner - an Awakened person who can summon spirits. Arcane power skill is Conjuring (Spirit.)

These Arcane Backgrounds can be taken individually, or combined to produce the classic Shadowrun archetypes:

* *Mystic adept*: Physical adept plus any other.
* *Full mage*: one of the spellcasting arcane backgrounds, plus Summoner.

No other combinations are permitted.

## Spellcaster

Most of the Powers listed in SWADE are available equally to both kinds of spellcaster arcane backgrounds. The AB comes with three free Powers at chargen.

## Summoner

The Summoner arcane background only has two powers associated with it, both from core SWADE:

* *Summon Ally* - used to summon spirits.
* *Banish* - used to banish other people's summoned spirits. In a change from SWADE core rules, this is available at Seasoned rank and above.

For PCs, the AB comes with both powers at chargen.

{{% alert title="Todo" %}}overhaul spirits as follows:

* Set up six (?) basic spirit types: fire/earth/air/water, plus Beasts and Men. Maybe more.
* Each basic spirit type comes in three powers: lesser, normal, greater. So potentially 3*6 distinct sets of statblocks. Ugh.
* Each spirit type gets trappings & changes in powers to suit traditions of summoning mage.

## Astral space

Full mages get a free Astral Projection power. All other Awakened characters can purchase Astral Perception, either for 1 Power Point (for physical adepts) or for 1 power (everyone else.)

Activities on the Astral plane, including assensing and astral combat, are governed by the new Astral (Smarts) skill.

See [Astral Space]({{< relref "astral_space.md" >}}) for more details.
