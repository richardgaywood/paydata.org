## Special tactical ammo

Can only be used in shotgun-calibre weapons and at shorter ranges.

|                 	| DV      	| AP      	| Avail 	| Cost 	|     	|
|-----------------	|---------	|---------	|-------	|------	|-----	|
| Flechette/shot       	| +2      	| +5      	| 6R    	| 65¥  	| CRB 	|
| Gel rounds      	| +0S     	| +1      	| 2R    	| 25¥  	| CRB 	|
| Stick-n-Shock  	| -2S (e) 	| -5      	| 6R    	| 80¥  	| CRB 	|
| Tracker[^3]     	| -2      	| -2      	| 8R    	| 150¥ 	| RG  	|
| Capsule         	| -4      	| +4      	| 2     	| 5¥   	| RG  	|

*TODO: consider the anti-electronic ammo types from Kill Code*

## Exotic and restricted ammo

Very difficult to source, chemically unstable (so has a short shelf life), and expensive to purchase. Requires a downtime scene to purchase. Only available for larger calibre weapons (heavy pistols, SMGs, all kinds of rifles). Not available for light pistols or machine pistols.

|                 	| DV      	| AP      	| Avail 	| Cost 	|     	|
|-----------------	|---------	|---------	|-------	|------	|-----	|
| APDS            	| -1       	| -4      	| 14F   	| 120¥ 	| CRB 	|
| Explosive[^4]       	| +1      	| -1      	| 9F    	| 80¥  	| CRB 	|
| Ex-Ex[^4]         	| +2      	| -1      	| 14F   	| 120¥ 	| RG  	|

When fired against mundane targets, APDS halves the number of automatic soak roll hits usually gained from hardened armour. APDS does -8 AP versus vehicles.

## Ammo for non-standard weapons

|                 	| DV      	| AP      	| Avail 	| Cost 	|     	|
|-----------------	|---------	|---------	|-------	|------	|-----	|
| Injection darts 	| -       	| -       	| 4R    	| 75¥  	| CRB 	|
| Taser dart      	| -       	| -       	| 3     	| 50¥  	| CRB 	|
| Flare[^2]       	| -2 / +2 	| +2 / -3 	| 6R    	| 20¥  	| RG  	|
| Assault cannon  	| -       	| -       	| 12F   	| 400¥ 	| CRB 	|

There's more here in the splatbooks; flame thrower canisters, laser battery cells, etc.

[^1]: Barriers struck with frangible rounds resist with 2x armour rating.
[^2]: First number applies at range shorter than 60 m. Second number is at range 60-62 m.
[^3]: Has an embedded RFID tag.
[^4]: Very loud when fired, and easier to detect with chemsniffers.
