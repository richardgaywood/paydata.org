## Magical edges

Mage characters will need to take one or two special Edges in order to become mages. These Edges, in effect, unlock a whole skill tree. See [Arcane Backgrounds]({{< relref "arcane_backgrounds.md" >}}) for more information.

## Edges with required 'augmentation' trapping

In my houserules, certain standard SWADE edges are modified to require an "augmentation" trapping. This means they are only available as either bioware or a physical adept power. These Edges are all listed below. For details on how the trappings work, see [Bioware]({{< relref "../augmentations/bioware.md" >}}) and [Adept Powers]({{< relref "../augmentations/adept_powers.md" >}}).

NB: for avoidance of doubt: only characters with the Adept arcane background can use the Adept Power trapping. And mages who take edges with the Bioware trapping suffer the same -1 penalty to magic rolls as if they'd taken one of the Cyberware edges.

The above doesn't effect cyberware, which follows standard Sprawlrunners rules; ie., you take Cyberware edges that grant implant points (see below), then spend those implant points on specific cyberware that grant you buffs and abilities (see [Cyberware]({{< relref "../augmentations/cyberware.md" >}})).

## New and amended Edges

### Background Edges

#### Quick

Only available with [augmentation trapping]({{< relref "../augmentations/" >}}).

### Cyberware Edges

These are edges that give a character implant points, that they can (in turn) spend on getting cyberware.

{{% pageinfo %}}
#### Implanted

Per Sprawlrunners RAW, the Implanted edge doesnâ€™t cost an Edge point, and once you take it, you can have any amount of zero-implant-point cyberware. This might seem slightly counter-intuitive, but that's because *it only exists to track the effect of these implants on magic users*. 

As such it is functionally equivalent to a rule that says "Anybody can take any amount of 0-cost implants they like. However, mages or shamans with any number of 0-point implants take a -1 penalty to all magic rolls, which stacks with any penalties from the Chromed edges." 

If you character is not a mage of any kind, you can skip the Implanted edge entirely, as it has no effect on you. If your character is a mage, and you do want to take some zero-implant-point cyberware, that's the only time you need to take it. 

Note that if you take Implanted on savaged.us, it'll use up one of your perk points, as there's no way to zero-out the cost of an Edge on there. So just skip adding it on the site, and only add it to your character sheet later if you need it.
