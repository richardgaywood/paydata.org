Catalyst themselves have had a pass at the idea of a less crunchy Shadowrun, in the form of [Shadowrun: Anarchy](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/194759/Shadowrun-Anarchy). As a system it has good bones but is criminally underbaked in lots of different ways. Youâ€™ll likely quickly find yourself looking for more houserules to bolt on. If so, start by taking a look at [Surprise Threat!](https://www.surprisethreat.com/), which has lots and lots of thoughtful suggestions. 
 
(The world would be a better place if the author of Surprise Threat! was given free reign to write Anarchy 2e, but we are where we are.)
