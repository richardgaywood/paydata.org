These rules are canon for my current campaign.

* **Normal characters have a maximum initiation grade of 6, and a maximum Magic attribute of 12**. Getting beyond that is out of reach for PCs or normal NPCs (barring dragons, immortal elves, Things Man Was Not Meant To Know, etc.)
	* If it ever matters, I might add in a way for grade 6 initiates to continue to learn new metamagics. Seems unlikely my campaign will need it, however.


## Metamagics

### Quickening

* The total maximum Force of all quickened spells on one person or object is equal to the lowest Magic stat that was used to cast any of the spells.
* Dispelling a quickened spell now only disrupts it. It can be restored via a ritual that takes a few minutes.
* Quickened spells cast on living subjects with a Magic stat "bed in" to the subject's aura over a period of a few hours. They cannot be detected other than by assensing, and they can be hidden via the masking metamagic power. They can also pass through mana barriers unimpeded.
