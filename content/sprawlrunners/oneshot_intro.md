## Savage Worlds five minute tour

**Core dice mechanic**: Attributes and Skills are collectively called Traits. Traits have a die type as a stat (d4, d6, ...). Players roll the die for their Trait plus a d6 called the _Wild die_. Dice explode and keep adding onto the total when their maximum value is rolled. Whichever of the Trait die and the Wild die rolls highest is kept and compared to a target number. Equalling or beating the target number is a _success_; beating it by four or more is a _raise_. Sometimes we also count how many raises you get.

* Lesser NPCs don't get Wild die, only powerful/named ones do.

**Combat resolution**: roll your Fighting, Shooting, or Athletics (for thrown weapons) Trait against a target number set by either the range or the opponent's Parry stat. If you succeed, roll the weapon's damage and compare to the target's Toughness stat. If you roll higher, the target will be Shaken (briefly stunned) or Wounded. 

* If the attack roll is a raise, you can roll an extra d6 on the damage.
* Damage dice also explode!

## Shadowrun

_The year is 2071. The world has changed, some say Awakened._
