## Weapon changes

Almost all of this are stock SprawlRunners & SWADE; gathered here for quick reference.

### Modifications

These are intrinsic to the weapon when it is purchased. Below are the standard Sprawlrunners ones:

* Machine pistol (+1LP, RoF 2)
* Burst fire mode (SMG/AR) (+1LP)
* Compact frame (+1LP, -25% shots, -2 penalty to Notice)
* Foldable stock (+1LP, -1 penalty to Notice when folded, 1 Action to deploy, -1 if shoot without deploying stock)
* Reinforced frame (+1LP, flechette pistol can fire slugs)

And some houseruled additions:

* Revolver: reduced shots (already reflected in statline). If it is a smartgun, character can load different ammo types in different cylinders, and choose which cylinders to fire for each attack via a mental command as a free action.
* Heavy calibre: applies +1 AP, requires 1 more die type in Str. Costs +1LP.
* Extended mag: +33% shots, +1LP, +2 to Notice due to the weapon's awkward shape.

### Accessories

* Bipod (+1LP, negate recoil/min Str penalty, takes action to deploy)
* Gas vent system (+1LP, -1 recoil penalty)
* Gyro-mount harness (+3LP, remove recoil or unstable platform penalty)
* Laser sight (+1LP) (+1 bonus at short range)
* Scope (+1LP, +1LP for low light/thermal, cancel 2 additional penalty points when Aiming)
* Smartgun (+1LP)
* Suppressor (+1LP, -2 to Notice)

### Ammo types

* APDS (+1LP, +1 AP)
* Ex-Ex (+1LP, +1 damage, can cook off)
* Gel rounds (+1LP, set AP to 0, non-lethal damage)

### Cosmetic trappings

* *Imposing* - oversized; bulky; threatening.
* *Blinged* - made of mirror-polished chrome; public AR broadcast of a killcount holo.
* *Sleek* - matte black; no protrusions; looks militaristic and efficient.
* *Tacticool* - thinks it is *sleek* but is actually covered in superfluous grips, accessory ports, flashlights, and other junk only valued by weekend warriors.
* *Sci-fi* - weird shapes; modern smart materials; sculpted to look bio-organic; covered in neon lights.
* *Double-barrelled*
