## Lifestyle SINs

Every 'runner has a fake SIN (or perhaps a set of fake SINs) that they live their day-to-day lives under: buying groceries, paying rent, running their GridGuide subscription, that sort of thing. They don't use this for criminal work, because it would make them far too easy to track down. There is no overhead associated with this, it's absorbed in day-to-day living costs.

Although they last a long time, these fake SINs aren't particularly good, and can't pass a lot of inspection. Most people interacting with it -- like 'runner's landlords -- most likely know it's fake, but aren't the kind of people who are looking too closely. This is one reason 'runners tend to live in the less gentrified neighbourhoods.

## Throwaway fake SINs

Where necessary, 'runners can buy extra fake SINs for a job.

A fake SIN will pass simple ID checks from a beat cop on the street automatically. The fake datastream associated with the SIN might stand up to a consistency check, should the 'runner try anything that might provoke one; for example, infiltrating a secure area through the front door via a fake identity. <!-- TODO --> *In Sprawlrunners game terms: roll a Notice check for whoever is inspecting the SIN to see if they spot any weirdness in the analysis results. This might be a +/- 1, depending on the resources of the corp doing the check.*

Gear licences for these SINs are "open carry", in the sense that the presence of the licence is automatically broadcast alongside the SIN. This can (obviously) attract attention, and often does. 

Fake SINs are inserted into tracking databases via hacks that are quickly discovered and deleted. They are typically only useful for a week or so.

### High quality fake SINs

If you're really up to something nefarious, you can purchase a high-end fake SIN. 

These are far better quality, with skilled counterfeiters creating near-impeccable fake histories spanning multiple databases. They pass all simple ID checks and consistency checks automatically. They might, or might not, pass a biometric test run against the SIN database of whoever ostensibly issued the fake. *In game terms, this is a Notice check by the host/system running the scan - typically a d6-d10 rating.*

Licences on high quality fake SINs can be open carry, or if the purchaser prefers, "concealed carry" -- meaning the SIN broadcast does not tag the person as carrying concealed weaponry. They are still licensed, however, and get to be extra rude and snooty to any beat cops who notice their gun, stop them assuming they are unlicensed, then discover they are (seemingly) VIPs. 

High quality fake SINs are still deleted after ~1 week, though, just like low-quality ones.

## FAQs about SINs

### Why can't the cops look up my DNA/fingerprints/etc that I left at the crime scene?

Although many SIN issuers do gather and store a biometric profile, they don't make this information available to the authorities (except, rarely, in the case of serious and high-profile crimes like terrorism.) So even if you do have a SIN in someone's database, it's very unlikely to be accessible to anyone investigating your crime... with the exception below.

### What about criminal SINs?

Most nation-states will issue special "criminal SINs" to anyone convicted of crimes, petty or otherwise. If you're unlucky enough to get issues a criminal SIN in, say, the UCAS, then any UCAS-jurisdiction cop is going to be able to read your fingerprints off their database. This can be a severe pain the ass for you and your criminal associates.

Even worse, criminal SINs are an exception to the hold-your-cards-close-to-your-chest rules most SINs are kept under. The SIN and its biometrics are shared widely and freely - that's most of the point; a criminal SIN is an anchor you have to drag around forever. (Unless you have friends in high places who can get it wiped off the books, *omae*.)

Corporations don't bother with criminal SINs. They prefer more immediate punishments.
