The metaplanes that spirits call home are infinite in number and impossible to imagine in totality. However, the most common spirits accessible to mages in the Sixth World are divided into archetypal groups, called *greatforms*. There are six primary greatforms: earth, air, water, fire, beasts, and man. (Some NPC-only spirits, like insect spirits and blood spirits, fall outside this classification.)

Greatforms are not specific spirits that are summoned but rather families of spirits from which a summoner can draw. When drawn into this world, the spirit takes on characteristics determined by the summoner's subconcious mind. These are called *minor forms*, and there are infinite numbers of them. 

Each minor form "belongs" to a specific greatform. For example, spirits of air could be summoned as Tornado spirits, Storm spirits, or Cloud spirits. Each of these minor forms has a statblock and is associated with one of the spirit power levels - lesser, common, or greater.

Greatforms and minor forms are linked to SWADE skills as follows: 

* Each greatform is a separate instance of the Summon Ally power. For example, a hermetic mage might start play with Summon Ally (Fire) and Summon Ally (Earth). Mages can learn more of these through advances, as usual.
* When a mage first learns the ability to summon a new greatform, the player defines the first specific minor form it will take for that mage. This is specific to the character and to their magical tradition, and players are encouraged to roleplay our what a given spirit might mean to a given mage. This involves creating the stats for each minor form at a specific power level - Lesser, Common, or Greater.
* During play, the mage might want to learn more minor forms. A new power, More Minor Forms, allows this; the mage may create two new minor forms for any greatforms they know.

Eddie the chaos mage starts the campaign at Seasoned rank. He learns two greatforms with his initial powers: Summon Ally (Fire) and Summon Ally (Man).

Eddie's player Bobby creates two new spirit types that he feels embodies the philosophy of a chaos mage and fit the greatforms Eddie can summon: Blaze (a lesser spirit of fire) and Hearth (a lesser spirit of man.)

Later in the campaign, Eddie advances to Veteran rank. He now gets to create two new common spirits, one for each of his greatforms. Bobby creates stats and powers for an Inferno spirit (of fire) and a Trickster spirit (of man).

Eddie's next advance is used to purchase a new summoning power - Summon Ally (Earth). Bobby can immediately create two new types of earth spirit for Eddie to use. He creates a Mud spirit (lesser earth) and a Rock spirit (common earth.)

Now Eddie advances one more time. He takes the New Powers edge and decides to use one of the powers it grants on two new minor forms. Bobby creates their stats; they can be of any of the greatforms Eddie knows (Fire, Man, and Earth), and at any of the power levels Eddie can summon (lesser or common).

Finally, Eddie does one last advance, taking him to Heroic rank. This unlocks greater spirits. Bobby creates three new spirits, one per greatform that Eddie knows. Eddie is really a force to be reckoned with now!
