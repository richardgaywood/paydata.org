## Disallowed powers

All powers in SWADE (pgs 154--171) are allowed as part of the Mage arcane background, *except* the following:

* Drain Power Points - meaningless in a game that doesn't use power points.
* Object Reading - folded into assensing and the Astral skill.
* Burrow, Divination, Intangibility, Resurrection, Teleport, Zombie - contradict core Shadowrun canon.

## Notes/clarifications about specific powers

### Arcane Protection

Note that this overlaps somewhat with the Shielding edge (see Sprawlrunners, pg 17). I won't stop you taking Arcane Protection, but the edge is arguably more powerful and useful.

## Banish
Rank: Seasoned *(changed from Veteran in RAW)*\
Power Points: See below \
Range: LoS \
Duration: Instant 

*(NB: slightly changed from RAW.)*

Forces other summoned spirits back to the metaplanes. Opposed roll of caster's Conjuration skill versus the target spirit's Spirit. Success leaves the spirit Shaken; each raise inflicts a Wound. If the spirit is incapacitated, it is dismissed from service and returned to the metaplanes.

If the spirit is a companion (see Sprawlrunners pg 17), then it gets to roll the summoner's Spirit in addition to its own (choosing the highest dice, as usual.) Additionally, if incapacitated, it will not be permanently banished, but will return to the summoner's side after 1d4 days.

The power point cost, and hence roll penalty, is determined by the target spirit's rank, similarly to when it is summoned. Hence:

* Servant/Watcher: no modifier to roll
* Seasoned rank (lesser spirit): -2 to roll (4PP)
* Veteran rank (common spirit): -3 to roll (6PP)
* Heroic rank (greater spirit): -4 to roll (8PP)

### Illusion

By default, Illusions are mana-based; they only appear within the minds of living creatures. Purely technological systems like cameras or drone sensors see nothing. (Living characters with cybernetic senses like cybereyes still see the illusion, however.)

The Strong modifier (+2PP) instead produces a physical illusion, which does affect technological systems.

## Summon Ally (*Specific Greatform*)
Rank: Novice \
Power Points: See below \
Range: Smarts \
Duration: Instant 

Summons a spirit from the metaplanes to do the summoner's bidding. See [Summoning]({{< relref "summoning.md" >}}) for rules. The power point cost, and hence roll penalty, is determined by the target spirit's rank:

* Servant/Watcher: no modifier to roll
* Seasoned rank (lesser spirit): -2 to roll (4PP)
* Veteran rank (common spirit): -3 to roll (6PP)
* Heroic rank (greater spirit): -4 to roll (8PP)
