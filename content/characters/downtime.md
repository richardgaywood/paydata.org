##  Downtime actions
For every phase spent in downtime, you get four “scenes” that you can allocate to activities as you please. You also have to pay one amount of your lifestyle costs.

You get six scenes instead if you have any of the following augmentations: sleep regulator bioware (CRB); metabolic control adept power (CRB); booster endosont symbiotes (CF pg 123) or hyper-glucagon geneware (CF pg 160).

Spending one scene can give you any of the below options. Note: almost all tests should be resolved by buying hits, and Edge cannot be used in downtime.

### Leisure

(NB: you must spend at least one scene on leisure during each downtime cycle. All work & no play, etc etc.) A scene spent on leisure gives you:

* 3 free karma to spend on knowledge skills
* an additional 1 free karma to spend on qualities - either buying new positive ones (at 2x the listed price, as is normal for buying new qualities in play) or buying off existing negative ones.

You can save these karma points up, and you can combine them with regular karma for knowledge skills or qualities.

### Reflection & self-improvement

You gain 1 karma, to spend on whatever you want.

### Hang Out

Earn a number of Favour Markers equal to your Charisma. You can use these to pay off markers you owe or bank them against future times you ask the contact for help. You don’t need to declare which contacts the markers apply to now, you can hold them as a pool and use them for whichever contact you want later.

You should expect to have to owe contacts Favour Markers when you ask them for help during play. See **TBD link**

You can raise a contact’s loyalty by spending a number of markers equal to twice their new loyalty value. I will encourage you to do a bit of roleplaying around this event!  However, note you cannot raise a contact’s loyalty if you owe them any Favour Markers.

###  New Friends

Try and make a new contact, of any type you want.

Choose a contact rating for your new contact. Do an opposed test between your Charisma and the contact rating. If it succeeds, you find someone who will trust you enough to become a contact.

Yes, this means you’re unlikely to make friends above connection 3-5 this way. More powerful friends will need GM approval or to be made during normal play.

At the end of the downtime, the new contact will have loyalty 1.

### Side Hustle

You spend time pitching your skills to do side jobs for your contacts and your contacts’ contacts. See calculation below. Most characters can earn 750-2000¥ for one scene spent on Side Hustle. You can only spend one scene on this; your contacts and their contacts only have so many opportunities for these sorts of off-the-books odd jobs.

### Lie Low

If you haven’t gained any notoriety this month, you can spend 1 scene to reduce your notoriety by 1. You can only do this once per month.

### Acquire Gear

See below.

### Repair Gear

If you have an appropriate skill (Hardware for Matrix damage, Mechanic for vehicle/drone damage, etc), you can repair up to your total dice pool in damage track boxes across any of your gear for one scene’s worth of your time. You can spend multiple scenes on this if your gear is really badly banged up.

You have to have access to a facility; either a Garage/Workshop/Facility in your dwelling or access to one via a contact. If the character has their own, these add 25% to the character’s lifestyle cost.

There is no further cost; a supply of parts comes with the nuyen you paid for the garage/workshop/facility.

### Working for the man / working for the people

Convert nuyen to karma or karma to nuyen, at a rate of 2000¥:1. You can convert up to five points for one scene. You can only do this once per month.

### Rest & Recuperation

One scene is enough rest to heal any amount of physical damage short of being in overflow. If the character went into overflow on the last run, it takes two scenes to heal up. If you have a medical support contract, this is free. Otherwise it costs one favour marker per scene used.

### Magical Initiation

Take an extended test: Arcana + Intuition [Astral]() (initiate grade, 4 scenes)

If you can’t get all of this done in one piece of downtime, you can “bank” the scenes you have spent and to return to it during the next downtime phase.

### Learning spells

First buy the formula (see below.) Then resolve a test of (Spellcasting + Intuition) [magical lodge's force]

Like most downtime actions, don’t roll actual dice, just buy hits.

Substitute in Ritual Spellcasting or Alchemy if that’s what you’re learning

Learning the spell takes two entire scenes, divided by the number of hits on the test. This means you can learn more than one spell in a single scene, as long as you have 4+ hits on the test. Other than that, you don’t get any sort of refund for part-used scenes, however.

### Get Augmented

It takes time to have ‘ware installed, recover from the surgery, and then learn how to use your new abilities. This varies with how invasive the ‘ware is:
* 0-1 Essence: 1 scene 
* 1-2 Essence: 2 scenes 
* 2-3: 4 scenes 
* 3+: 6 scenes 

### Training Montage

Except where noted below, increasing skills or attributes doesn’t require any scenes. You pick it up on the job, so to speak. Knowledge skill increases never require a scene.

However, these increases do need downtime:

* Increasing an attribute to higher than 2 points less than your racial maximum (ie 4 for humans): 2 scenes 
* Increase a skill beyond 6: 2 scenes 

### Other

Each scene can be used for 60 hours of downtime to do things like binding spirits, enchanting, making gear, etc. Anything that needs extended tests in the book and isn’t mentioned above can be done via this scene.




##  Appendix: Important Acknowledgements

I didn't realise I wanted downtime rules until I looked at [the ones from A Light In the Dark][2]… then I immediately saw that I did. A few things didn't fit though; they're optimised for a living campaign, so they're a bit too detailed in places and a bit too simple in others.

So I wrote my own, which you can read here.

I've never been completely happy with how I've handled downtime. It felt a little like an underbaked idea, a randomised tax the GM imposes; "well done for finishing that run. It's now going to be... ummm, let's say three weeks until your next one. Pay lifestyle costs. OK next run!" This system puts players in control, with a series of options they can pursue. Hopefully, the balancing works where all the options have their own attractions, without anything being overly powerful or creating a cognitive dissonance around "well, why are these people shadowrunners, then?”

I've tried to minimise dice rolling, including a speedy gear acquisition path that makes stuff easier to get hold off when the schedule isn't tight. I've added a sort of resource currency for contacts, to represent the flow of favours back and forth to them, and hopefully give a little flavour of being part of a group of criminals. I've added zero-cost healing and repair options to recover between runs.

I've also taken the chance to buff a few things I feel are a little underpowered in RAW. Sleep regulators become quite potent, for example. Faces should shine here, able to butter up contacts for future favours as well as find new contacts more easily. People with good technical skills might make a non-trivial amount of nuyen on side hustles, which is more for feel and plot hooks than anything else.

Feedback welcomed! I'm still very much moving some of the numbers around, and trying to balance options against each other; I expect this will continue as it gets a proper playtest. But to tell me if you spot any egregious oversights or exploits.

For all the work I’ve done, this remains very closely based on these houserules for A Light In The Dark SR living campaign. All credit for any goodness here belongs to them. Anything you don’t like was probably something I added. More credit goes to u/mercilessming\_, from whose [houserules][3] I derived further inspiration & the term “scene” which was much better than what I had before..
