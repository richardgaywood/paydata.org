These are closely based on the rules in [Justin Licht's Savage Worlds / Shadowrun conversion](https://www.pegforum.com/forum/savage-worlds/savage-worlds-homebrew-conversions-discussion/38813-savage-worlds-shadowrun-5e-conversion) (also available [directly on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NM0YIgb0tNVfZm_SjCxk9DL6QulkoVFi).)

Note that these are based around +4 racial attributes per race, rather than the standard SWADE +2. This change gives each race more room to breath and be more closely modelled on the original Shadowrun races. The races are still balanced against each other. I think it also balances against some of the racial traits granted being quite situational or easily replicated with advanced gear in a cyberpunk setting (eg low-light or thermal vision.)

Note also that players in my campaign using [my custom setting in savaged.us](https://savaged.us/s/qlp2jxy3) don't need to do anything extra to use the rules below; they are already applied correctly in Savaged.

## Human

* Adaptable (2): Humans seem to have an unlimited ability to adapt to their circumstances. They begin with a free Novice Edge.
* Lucky (2): Fortune smiles on base-model humans. They start with the Lucky Edge, meaning they get four Bennies when refreshed.

## Dwarf

* Thermal Vision (1): Dwarves see heat. This halves Illumination penalties when attacking warm targets (including invisible beings).
* Focused (2): They are single-minded people and start with a d6 to Spirit (with a maximum limit of d12+1).
* Tough (2): Their resiliency and natural resistance to toxins and poisons is renowned. Dwarves start with a d6 in Vigor (with a maximum limit of d12+1).
* Short Legs (-1): Being stout and having short legs means Dwarves don’t cover as much ground as the rest of metahumanity. Their Pace and running die are reduced by one.

## Elf

* Low Light Vision (1): Elves ignore penalties for Dim or Dark illumination (but not Pitch Darkness).
* Agile (2): Graceful and quick, Elves start with a d6 in Agility (with a maximum of d12+1).
* Attractive (2): Considered to be the ideal image of desirability in metahumanity, elves are idolized by most and add +1 to Performance and Persuasion rolls.
* Slight (-1): They might be slender and graceful, but they tend to hurt a little easier than other metatypes. Elves subtract one from Toughness.

## Ork

* Low Light Vision (1): Orks ignore penalties for Dim or Dark illumination (but not Pitch Darkness).
* Strong (2): Stronger than most metatypes, Orks start with a d6 in Strength (with a maximum of d12+1).
* Tough (2): Orks are hardy and tough. They start with a d6 in Vigor (with a maximum of d12+1).
* Downtrodden (-1): Nearly on the opposite end of the social acceptance ladder from elves, orks tend to grow up marginalized. They have the Outsider (Minor) Hindrance.

## Troll

* Thermal Vision (1): Trolls see heat. This halves Illumination penalties when attacking warm targets (including invisible beings).
* Insanely Strong (4): As the strongest metatype, Trolls start with a d8 in Strength (with a maximum of d12+2).
* Brickhouse (2): Trolls can take a beating. They start with a d6 in Vigor (with a maximum of d12+1).
* Dermal Plates (1): Bony deposits on their skin grant them +1 to Toughness.
* Oversized (-2): It’s not easy living in a world made for smaller beings. Trolls subtract 2 from Trait rolls when using equipment that wasn’t specifically designed for them and cannot wear armor or clothing designed for other metatypes. Equipment, food, and clothing cost double the listed price.
* Ostracised (-1): Trolls have suffered the most from marginalization, and are often looked upon with prejudice and stereotyped as dumb knuckle draggers. They often have little recourse other than resorting to crime or security work to make ends meet. They begin with the Outsider (Minor) Hindrance.
* Too Big To Hide (-1): Trolls tend to be terrible at moving quietly and hiding. Can you blame them, they’re huge! Stealth is not a Core Skill (starts Untrained instead of at d4).
