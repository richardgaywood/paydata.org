description: A master list of all my Shadowrun houserules and rule ideas

{{% pageinfo %}} 
This section contains a variety of houserules. Some of these are canon for my current campaign; others are ideas we are discussing; others are just sketches of things I might flesh out in the future.

## Attn: my PCs

For avoidance of doubt, here's all the houserules that are in use in our current campaign:

* [Downtime][1] and [Contacts][2] are a linked set of rules that cover what you character can get done between missions, and how they can earn their contact's favours for the future.
* [Simplified skills][3] slightly reduces the overall skill count in SR5e and makes some changes to skill groups to make life a little easier for archetypes like deckers and riggers.
