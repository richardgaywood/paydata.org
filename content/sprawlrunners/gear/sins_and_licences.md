SINs are the most obvious and visible way that Sixth World society draws a line between the haves and the have-nots. To be SINless is to fall outside the system on almost every measure - no support, no right to employment or vote, unable to use public facilities, turned away from shops and restaurants, even your basic human rights are reduced. 

## Lifestyle SIN

Every 'runner has a fake SIN that they live their day-to-day lives under: buying groceries, paying rent, running their GridGuide subscription, that sort of thing. They don't use this for work, because it makes them far too easy to track down.

Although it lasts a long time, this fake SIN isn't particularly good, and won't pass a lot of inspection. Most people who use it -- like their landlords -- most likely know it's fake, but aren't the kind of people who are looking too closely. This is one reason 'runners tend to live in the less gentrified neighbourhoods.

## Fake SINs

Where necessary, 'runners can buy extra fake SINs for a job (1 LP for a SIN, 0.25 LP per type for a licence - civilian or security firearms, magic, cyberdecks, security-spec vehicles or gear. Milspec gear like APDS or Ex-Ex ammo, heavy weapons, very heavy armour cannot be licensed this way.)

Matrix protocols have special provisions for SIN broadcasts, sent out at all times from your commlink. These can be checked by authorities like corpsec and local police just by glancing at you; in nicer parts of town, checks like this are routine and not broadcasting a SIN is immediate grounds for suspicion. (Note that in very rough parts of town, where police only travel in entire squads or not at all, broadcasting a SIN becomes a mark that you are easy prey. Choose wisely.)

A fake SIN will pass basic inspection from a beat cop on the street automatically, and might stand up to modest scrutiny eg. infiltrating a secure area through the front door via a fake identity.

Gear licences for these SINs are "open carry", in the sense that the presence of the licence is broadcast alongside the SIN. This can (obviously) attract attention, and often does.

Fake SINs are inserted into tracking databases via hacks that are soon deleted via consistency checks. They are typically deleted within a week or so.

## High quality fake SINs

If you're really up to something nefarious, you can purchase a high-end fake SIN - 4 LP for the SIN, 1 LP per licence. 

These are far better quality, with skilled counterfeiters creating near-impeccable fake histories spanning multiple databases. They are almost undetectable to all bar the most serious of ID checks.

They are still deleted after ~1 week, though.
