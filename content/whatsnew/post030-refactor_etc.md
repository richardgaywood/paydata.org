Lots of small edits and cleanups all over the site, including shuffling around old content into new places that makes more sense. Tightened up some text in edits and changed some outdate older rules that we were no longer using. Discarded some of my less sensible changes.

Plus, specific other changes:

* Removed the concept of "bioware", which I only introduced to distinguish between Edges that require an augmentation trapping and cyberware. On balance, I think adding a whole concept just for that was more confusing that just not having one. Now, the [Edges]({{< relref "edges.md" >}}) page itself just lists the cyberware trapping.
* Reverted the smartlink cyberware back to the RAW version, so it now cancels 2 points of penalty to Shooting rolls, regardless of the source of the penalty.
