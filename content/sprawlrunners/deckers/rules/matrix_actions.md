## File and device actions

{{% pageinfo %}} 
Action: **Manipulate files** \
Rolls: N/A \
Use on: any file(s)

Can be used to copy, edit, erase, or search for files in any kind of data store - a host, a node, a commlink, a data chip, etc.

Doesn't usually require a test, but if a series of edits to the files have to fool someone (or the erases to be made are subtle eg. removing entries in an access log) then a test might be needed.

Copying or erasing a very large number of files under time pressure might be a dramatic task.

{{% pageinfo %}} 
Action: **Decrypt file** \
Requires: Decryption utility \
Rolls: Hacking (xxx) vs file encryption rating die type \
Use on: any encrypted file

Decrypting a number of files is usually a dramatic task.

## Rigger & drone actions

{{% pageinfo %}} 
Free action: **Jump in**

Used by a rigger to assume jumped-in control of a drone or vehicle. 

This is a normal action if the rigger is not already connected via a cable or a drone deck's s-PAN.
{{% /pageinfo %}} 



{{% pageinfo %}} 
Free action: **Give command**

Give a one-sentence command to a drone or vehicle autopilot. If the rigger is using a drone deck and has multiple drones/vehicles in its s-PAN, they can issue the same command to any number of the drones/vehicles for a single free action.
