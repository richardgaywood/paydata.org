These are some ideas on how to combine ManuFS's [Furious Magic supplement](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/390475) with [Sprawlrunners](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/334278) and [MagusRogue's Guide to the Sprawl](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/384941). It draws on all three of these books to hopefully present a coherent whole.

Note that _this is not currently canon for our campaign_. These are just some ideas for now and need further fleshing out before they will be ready to play.

## Power Edges

### Unchanged

The following Sprawlrunners Power Edges are left unchanged: all the Chi/Physical Adept ones, Weapon Focus, Flexible Signature, Lord of the Spirits, Masking, Shielding, Spirit Companion. See below for notes on the other Focus Edges.

All the Edges in Furious Magic are left unchanged, although several do not apply to Sprawlrunners as there are no Weird Scientists. 

### Initiation

The Shadowrun concept of Initiation is translated to Furious Magic by using the Higher Spheres Edge. For plot reasons, if the GM is requiring a metaplanar initiation quest, I suggest skipping the Seasoned variant of Higher Spheres; just do it at Higher Spheres II (which is equivalent to "Initiate") and III ("Greater Initiate").

## Focus Edges

Sprawlrunners's Focus Edges, in particular, need special handling.

### Force/Power Focus

{{% alert title="Notes" %}}TBD; it might be enough to use the same rules as the Conduit Edge from Furious Magic.{{% /alert %}}

### Sustaining Focus

When obtaining and binding the focus, the caster picks one Power that it is associated with. Whenever using that Power with an Extended Duration, the caster does not take the usual point of Fatigue when the Power ends and the caster does not suffer the usual -1 penalty to further arcane skill rolls while the Power is being sustained. 

Note that this contrasts with Focus Effort, which works with any Power the caster chooses but prevents them from maintaining a second Power at the same time.

### Spell Focus

When obtaining and binding the focus, the caster picks one Power that it is associated with. If the spellcaster gets a Backlash on that spell, the focus absorbs the damage instead, and the caster does not suffer the effects of the Backlash. 

The focus's astral link to the caster is disrupted by this and it must be re-bound before it can be used again (takes hours; GM discretion; likely cannot be used again until after the next Downtime phase.) 

On a Critical Backlash, the caster avoids Backlash but still has to roll on the Uncontrolled Magic table.

{{% alert title="Example" %}}Eddie takes a Spell Focus for the Blast Power. He decides it's time to bring the hurt against a group of mooks. He casts Blast, adding on the "extra area of effect", "extra damage", and "extra armour piercing" modifiers. As usual, he has to roll his arcane skill at -3, as there are three modifiers being used. Usually he would take Backlash on a roll of 1, 2, or 3. But instead, if he has a bad roll, the Spell Focus will absorb the effect of that. Lucky Eddie!{{% /alert %}} 

## Alchemy

* Spend 2 LP on reagents for any Power, add on +1 LP per modifier being applied. 
* Resultant preparation can be used by anyone, as per Artificer in the SWADE base rules. 
* The creator rolls Magic to activate the Power as normal at time of creation to determine the preparation's effectiveness & drain etc.  
* Preparation lasts 1d4+1 hours before it fades. 

{{% alert title="Notes" %}}Maybe can only do this after taking an Edge to unlock the ability.{{% /alert %}}

(this mostly based on MagusRogue's work)

## Mystic Adepts

Modelled as a new Arcane Background. Requires Spirit d6+, Fighting or Shooting d6+, Focus d6+.

* Uses Focus (Spirit) as their arcane skill
* Can only take Higher Spheres once
	* Novice powers: arcane protection, boost Trait, detect/conceal arcana, environmental protection, protection, relief, smite, wall walker.
	* Seasoned powers: damage field, deflection, disguise, healing, speed, warrior's gift.
* All Powers always have the Self limitation
* Chi Points can be used to purchase Powers interchangeably at a 1:1 ratio

{{% alert title="Notes" %}}I have removed _Burrow_ from the power list above, as I consider it incompatible with Shadowrun canon and a bit of an "I WIN!" button for infiltrating subterranean facilities. YMMV!{{% /alert %}}

## Spirit summoning

The Summon Ally power continues to be used to summon Shadowrun style spirits, but with the following limitations:

* Duration rules for the summoning follow the rules given in Furious Magic: a base duration of (Arcane Skill die type) minutes, or an Extended Duration of (Arcane Skill die type) hours. In Shadowrun terminology, an Extended Duration summoning is called "binding".
	* Binding does not count as a sustained power, so the caster does not take a -1 penalty on all arcane skill rolls during an Extended Duration summoning.
* A normal summoner can only have one spirit summoned at once. This limit can be increased by the Lord of the Spirits and Spirit Companion Edges in Sprawlrunners.
