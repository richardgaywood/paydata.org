My Matrix houserules are based on a backport of most of the new ideas from Shadowrun 6e to 5e.

However, I have not yet moved this document over from Google Docs to here. For now, you can [access it here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V-G6O3SOEJuuHBEzpOrTUpT9Owig_GqCUWcPeIZVAx4/edit). 

I have more plans to develop houserules in this area, starting with slimming down the list of Matrix actions to make it a bit more manageable.
