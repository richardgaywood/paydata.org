These rules attempt to simplify the Shadowrun 5e Matrix rules by removing a number of options. For quick reference, some of the changes made include:

* Streamline "AR / VR" and "in host / on grid" distinctions. Now, being in a host means always being in VR, and if you're not in a host then you are in AR.
* Broadly remove the concepts of personas and unhackable digital ownership.
* Distill all primary decker offensive actions to two kinds: hacking (stealthy, grants access) and cybercombat (violent, crashes devices.) 
* If a device is in a PAN or WAN, it cannot be hacked directly; the attacker must hack the PAN or WAN instead (as per Shadowrun 6e, to be fair.)
*
