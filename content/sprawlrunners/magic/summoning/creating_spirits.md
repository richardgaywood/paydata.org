Players who's characters follow magical traditions other than hermetic mage or shaman will have to create their own spirit stats as their character learns to summon new spirits. For the main, these will follow the rules in the Savage Worlds [Summoner's Circle](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/273484) supplement. You can freely define everything about the spirit.

## Common abilities

All spirits always have the following powers and abilities. Numbers in brackets are the points value from Summoner's Circle.

* **-4 damage to mundane ranged attacks (2)**: difficult to harm with physical objects alone.
* **Dual-natured (1)**: native to the astral plane; is always astrally perceiving at all times.
* **Elemental (5)**: doesn't need to eat or breathe; immune to poison/disease; immune to called shots; ignores 1 level of Wound penalties (although this only applies if the spirit is also Resilient or Very Resilient, as otherwise, 1 Wound is sufficient to disrupt the spirit.)
* **Extraplanar (-2)**: can be targeted by the Banish power.
* **Fearless (2)**: immune to fear effects.

Net total: 8 points.

## Spirits & Powers

Spirits can have the ability to use Powers (spells), with some notes and caveats:

* It takes 2 ally build points to take the first power, then 1 further point for each additional power they have access to.
* Any spirit that is to use Powers will need to take the Magic skill, which is paid for as normal (1 ally point per die type).
* Spirits use Powers using the No-Power-Point rules, the same as mages do.
* Spirits still suffer from a form of Drain when they roll a natural 1 on their Magic die, although this represents the spirit's link to the material plane being weakened rather than drain in the traditional sense.
* Spirits can take any Power players can, except for Summon Ally (!) and Banish. There are some additional powers below.

### Accident

Rank: Seasoned \
Power points: 2 \
Range: Smarts√ó2 \
Duration: Sustained

Causes the target to experience mishaps, slips, and other instances of bad luck at an accelerated rate. Whenever the target rolls a natural 1 on their skill die (regardless of the value of the wild die), they experience a crit-fail or similar effect.

Must be sustained as usual (ie. the spirit takes a -1 penalty on further Magic rolls while sustaining the power.) This -1 also applies to rolls to use magical spirit abilities that roll skills like Shooting or Athletics.

Modifier: **+2PP**: can effect all targets inside a Medium Blast Template.

## Spirit types

Spirits of Air : Fast and with a lots of Versatile Powers. Can be taken down fairly quickly by a Mage due to their low BOD.
Spirits of Earth : Super tanky but slow.
Spirits of Beasts : No particular weaknesses and good stats. Excellent perception and can control animals.
Spirits of Fire : Extremely strong combat spirits but not much to do outside (except if your mission is to burn stuff). Allergy Water can make them tricky to use in some situation (rain)
Spirits of Man : Good stats, no real weaknesses good Powers and can use spells. Infinite cheese potential.
Spirits of Water : Extremely versatile too (less that Spirits of Man ofc). Weather Control can allow you to create Fog to hide for example. Become ridiculously good in Water. They also have nice stuff to disable targets (Engulf, Binding). Fire is a fairly common damage type so their weakness can really hurt.
