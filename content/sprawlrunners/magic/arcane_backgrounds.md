These houserules contain quite a few changes from normal Sprawlrunners. The intent is to enable the addition of more magic traditions beyond hermetic mage and shaman. 

Note that this section assumes a reasonable familiarity with existing Shadowrun rules and canon for magic abilities; I won't do a full recap of them here.

RAW Sprawlrunners offers three types of Arcane Background - hermetic mage, shaman, and qi adept (like physical adepts in Shadowrun). 

For my game, I am moving these up a bit, into the following four Arcane Backgrounds:

* Physical / qi adept - the classic Shadowrun physad. Doesn't have an arcane power skill. Rules are the same as Sprawlrunners RAW.
* Intuitive spellcaster - magic users like shamans, whose approach to magic works on an artistic, instinctive, or naturalistic level. Arcane power skill is Sorcery (Spirit).
* Logical spellcaster - magic users like hermetic mages, whose approach to magic is more scientific, rigorous, or based on theoretical study. Arcane power skill is Sorcery (Smarts).
* Summoner - an Awakened person who can summon spirits. Arcane power skill is Conjuring (Spirit).

These Arcane Backgrounds can be taken individually, or combined to produce the classic Shadowrun archetypes:

* *Mystic adept*: Physical adept plus any one other.
* *Full mage*: one of the spellcasting arcane backgrounds, plus Summoner.

No other combinations are permitted.

## Spellcaster

Most of the powers listed in SWADE are available equally to both kinds of spellcaster arcane backgrounds. The arcane background comes with three free powers at chargen; these powers are broadly equivalent to spells in Shadowrun.

## Summoner

The Summoner arcane background only has three powers associated with it, two from core SWADE and one new one:

* *Summon Ally (greatform)*: used to summon spirits. Can be taken multiple times. Each version of it is specific to one greatform spirit.
* *Banish*: used to banish other people's summoned spirits. In a change from SWADE core rules, this is available at Seasoned rank and above.
* *New minor forms*: unlocks more spirit minor forms the mage can summon. Each time this power is taken, two more minor forms can be chosen. 

PCs can select three powers at chargen for free, as part of the arcane background.

For more information, see [Summoning]({{< relref "summoning.md" >}}).

## Astral space

Full mages get a free Astral Projection power. All other Awakened characters can purchase Astral Perception, either for 1 Power Point (for physical adepts) or for 1 power (everyone else.)

Activities on the Astral plane, including assensing and astral combat, are governed by the new Astral (Smarts) skill.

See [Astral Space]({{< relref "astral_space.md" >}}) for more details.
