Roll Summoning skill, taking a penalty according to the level of the spirit:

* Servant/Watcher: no modifier to roll
* Seasoned rank (Lesser spirit): -2 to roll (4PP)
* Veteran rank (Common spirit): -3 to roll (6PP)
* Heroic rank (Greater spirit): -4 to roll (8PP)

Take drain on a natural 1 as usual.

Spirit control is based on the concept of *favours*. Each spirit is summoned with two favours by default. Each Raise on the summoning roll adds another favour. If the mage is summoning a spirit of lesser rank than themselves (eg a Veteran mage summoning a lesser spirit), they get an extra bonus favour.

The spirit enters play, materialised on the physical plane, and can act immediately. In combat, they act on the same initiative card as their summoner. Mages can send mental commands to their summoned spirits as a free action.

Any commanded use of the spirit's powers outside of combat uses a single favour. Participation in an entire combat uses a favour. Remote service uses all remaining favours.

By default, summoners can only have one lesser/common/greater spirit summoned at a time. This does not count as maintaining a power, so there is no ongoing penalty to the mage's rolls. They can also keep one servant/watcher summoned.
