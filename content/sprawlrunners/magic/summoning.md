{{% pageinfo %}}These rules are only draft / for discussion. They are **not** canon and will almost certainly be changed before they become so.{{% /pageinfo %}} 


## Summary for discussion

* Spirits come in six different base types, called *greatforms*: earth; air; water; fire; beasts; man.
* Each greatform can be summoned in an endless number of variant *minor forms*. 
	* For example, spirits of air could be summoned as Tornado spirits, Storm spirits, or Cloud spirits.
	* Earth, air, fire, and water also each have special lesser forms called "elementals", which match up to the boring stereotypes used by dreary hermetic mages. There is no such thing as elementals of beasts or man, though.
	* Most stats and powers are common across all the minor forms of a single greatform. 

As per Sprawlrunners, each minor form can be summoned at three different power levels: Lesser, Common, and Greater. 

~*OR* Each minor form has a predefined power level when the mage learns how to summon them; a mage might know how to summon Lesser Mud spirits and Common Storm spirits. This requires a lot less work to create all the statblocks, but makes the mage less flexible.~

Then:

* Summoner characters get 4x starting Powers at chargen. (Suggested use: 3x greatform spirits and Banish.)
* As usual, the character can spend an Advance to learn 2x new Powers.
* Learning a new greatform is a Power. At that time, the player can define which minor form they are learning for the greatform, and create its stats at all three power levels.
* Adding more minor forms to greatforms you already know is also a Power, but you get to learn 2x minor forms for a single Power.

## Summoning process

Roll Summoning skill, taking a penalty according to the level of the spirit:

* Servant/Watcher: no modifier to roll
* Seasoned rank (Lesser spirit): -2 to roll (4PP)
* Veteran rank (Common spirit): -3 to roll (6PP)
* Heroic rank (Greater spirit): -4 to roll (8PP)

Take drain on a natural 1 as usual.

Spirit control is based on the concept of *favours*. Each spirit is summoned with two favours by default. Each Raise on the summoning roll adds another favour. If the mage is summoning a spirit of lesser rank than themselves, they get an extra bonus favour.

The spirit enters play, materialised on the physical plane, and can act immediately. In combat, they act on the same initiative card as their summoner. Mages can send mental commands to their summoned spirits as a free action.

Any commanded use of the spirit's power outside of combat uses a single favour. Participation in an entire combat uses a favour. Remote service uses all remaining favours.

By default, summoners can only have one lesser/common/greater spirit summoned at a time. This does not count as maintaining a power, so there is no ongoing penalty to the mage's rolls. They can also keep one servant/watcher summoned.

## Summoning powers

### Banish

*(Slightly changed from RAW.)*

Rank: Seasoned *(changed from Veteran in RAW)*\
Power Points: See below \
Range: Smarts \
Duration: Instant 

Forces other summoned spirits back to the metaplanes. Opposed roll of caster's Conjuration skill versus the target spirit's Spirit. Success leaves the spirit Shaken; each raise inflicts a Wound. If the spirit is incapacitated, it is dismissed from service and returned to the metaplanes.

If the spirit is a companion (see Sprawlrunners pg 17), then it gets to roll the summoner's Spirit in addition to its own (choosing the highest dice, as usual.) Additionally, if incapacitated, it will not be permanently banished, but will return to the summoner's side after 1d4 days.

The power point cost, and hence roll penalty, is determined by the target spirit's rank, similarly to when it is summoned. Hence:

* Servant/Watcher: no modifier to roll
* Seasoned rank (eg lesser elemental): -2 to roll (4PP)
* Veteran rank (eg 'standard'): -3 to roll (6PP)
* Heroic rank (eg greater elemental): -4 to roll (8PP)

spirit powers


When a Magician or Adept perceive in the Astral Plane they are able to use the Assensing ability and also see creatures and magic. A Magician or an Adept can also use spells to damage creatures from that plane of existence (for half damage). All stats go off of physical abilities as on the character sheet. For a Magician to fully interact with the Astral Plane he must leave his body and project his essence there. While on the Astral Plane any spell cast on a creature there does full damage. Things on the Astral Plane happens faster than in the real world, so if combat is split between the Astral Plane and the physical world, resolve what happens on the Astral Plane in a combat round before the physical plane.
While on the Astral Plane treat a Magicianâ€™s Mental Attributes as one higher than on the character sheet (this goes for Critters as well). Ignore physical attributes. For resisiting damage directed at the Magician or for critters follow this:
Agility- Use Smarts; Strength and Vigor- Use Spirit.
