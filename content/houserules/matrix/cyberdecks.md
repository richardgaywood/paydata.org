Stats are unchanged from RAW; Cyberdecks have an attribute array that can be allocated across the four Matrix stats. Takes a Free action to swap any two stats. Remember you can only do one Free action per turn. If you want to do more reconfiguring than that, you can use Matrix Simple Actions.

Cyberdecks are reduced in price to 25% of RAW. See [the gear houserules]({{< relref "electronics.md#cyberdecks" >}}) for more information and statblocks.

## Programs

*Maybe* 

* decrease to ((Deck Rating) / 2) slots?
* add a few more impactful ones?
* add a one-shot +2 dice boosts that burn out after use? (like trinkets) (deckers craft these with Software in downtime?)

### Hacking programs

* **Chaff**: any attempt to Trace Icon against the persona will be inaccurate by (1d6 * 10) metres; if the direction matters, use the scatter rules. This also applies to the tracing that happens after convergence from GOD. (Replaces Cry Wolf.)

## Agents

* Deck can only run agents of a rating equal to or less than the deck rating.
* Agent stats are equal to the deck rating and deck's ASDF, agent skills are equal to its rating. Hence agents are typically rolling ((agent rating) + (deck rating)) as a dice pool.
* If used to assist the decker on an action, it takes a Simple Action to order the agent to help. Then it rolls its dice pool as a teamwork test.
* Agents running the same task repeatedly (eg Matrix perception) are subject to the same -1 penalty per repeated attempt as any other character. Additionally, this will typically be resolved by buying hits.
