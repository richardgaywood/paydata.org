Some streamlining to [summoning]({{< relref "sprawlrunners/magic/summoning/summoning.md" >}}) 

* Drop concept of services, spirits just last some number of hours now
* A raise on the summoning roll makes the spirit tougher instead of granting more services
* Add a reminder to the page about the Power Preparation rule from core SWADE
