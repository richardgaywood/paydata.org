For avoidance of doubt, here's all the houserules that are in use in our current campaign:

* [Downtime]({{< relref "downtime.md" >}}) and [Contacts]({{< relref "contacts.md" >}}) are a linked set of rules that cover what you character can get done between missions, and how they can earn their contact's favours for the future.
* [Simplified skills]({{< relref "skills.md" >}}) slightly reduces the overall skill count in SR5e and makes some changes to skill groups to make life a little easier for archetypes like deckers and riggers.
* My [streamlined action economy]({{< relref "action_economy.md" >}}) changes initative tracking, eliminates multiple passes, and gives streetsams and physads a powerful new multi-attack option.
* For magicians there are houserules for [summoning]({{< relref "summoning.md" >}}), [foci]({{< relref "foci.md" >}}) and [initiation]({{< relref "initiation.md" >}}). I've also added a new capability to create [trinkets]({{< relref "reagents.md" >}}) from reagents.
* For the Matrix, I am currently using [these houserules]({{< relref "rules.md" >}}) which attempt to bring the Shadowrun 6e Matrix rules back into Shadowrun 5e. However, I am also working on a comprehensive Matrix rules re-write, which I hope to have ready soon.
* Gear houserules:
  * [Electronics houserules]({{< relref "electronics.md" >}}) reduce the price of cyberdecks
  * [Drugs]({{< relref "drugs.md" >}}) removes psyche, which is painfully OP for magicians.
