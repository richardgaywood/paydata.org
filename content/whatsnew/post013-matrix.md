Substantial edit pass through the [matrix section]({{< relref "sprawlrunners/matrix" >}}). No big rules changes, just lots of rewording to use consistent terms and explain stuff better.
 
* Matrix stats for all types of devices now consolidated to [an easier to read table]({{< relref "sprawlrunners/matrix/devices.md" >}}) 
* Added [hacking vehicles]({{< relref "hacking_vehicles.md" >}}) page to the rigger section. 
* Added *Parabellum* to the [commlink defence programs]({{< relref "sprawlrunners/matrix/additional_rules.md" >}})
* Still need to do more on [dronedecks]({{< relref "drone_decks.md" >}}).
