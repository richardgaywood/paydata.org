Mission rewards in-game can be in a variety of forms: hard currency like UCAS dollars, untraceable digital currency like nuyen on certified credsticks, corporate scrip, large quantities of easily resold or bartered product like high-grade pharmaceuticals or ICE breaker software -- or even (for the seriously old fashioned) precious metals, gemstones, or bearer bonds. 

In game mechanics, we handle all of these as [Payout]({{< ref "payouts.md" >}}). Each point of Payout awarded after a mission buys one Downtime Action that you can do before the money runs out and it's time to look for work again.

## Notes on resolving Downtime Actions

- Downtime Actions do not have to be all declared upfront. For example, an injured character might choose to use their first action on Rest & Recuperation, and then depending on how the roll goes, might repeat the action or switch to something else.
- When Downtime Actions require any kind of die roll, note that you cannot spend Bennies on this roll. Bennies are for when the camera is focused on your character!
- If your character is currently experiencing [Heat]({{< ref "heat.md" >}}), all rolls will be opposed. 
- Although Advancing typically happens _during_ downtime, it does not have to, and it does not take a downtime action when it does.

## Long term goals

{{% boxout type="action" title="Change The World" %}}

Each Downtime action spent allows you to roll a relevant Trait (explaining how the Trait contributes to the goal, if it isn't obvious.) Like a Dramatic Task, xxx

We'll handle this a bit like a Dramatic Task in SWADE or a Clock in Blades in the Dark. You'll have some fixed number of segments to complete - you might or might not know how many, depending on what you are up to. For a single downtime action, you can make a Trait r using any appropriate skill to work on the project. This test will 

Test success will tick a segment on the progress clock. Each Raise will tick a further segment. On a critical failure, you lose one segment. 


When you complete a Change The World project, you gain Conviction.

{{% boxout type="action" title="Build your stash" %}}
If your character is saving up for something long-term (eg retirement from this endless cycle of violence...), then you can spend a Downtime action to divert funds to it. Each action "buys" one point of Stash. How many points you'll need depends on what you're saving for...
{{% /boxout %}}



## Healing & recovery actions {#recover}

{{% boxout type="action" title="Lie Low" %}}
If you attracted an unusually breathtaking amount of attention on the last run and so have a [Heat or Hunted Die]({{< relref "heat.md" >}}), you can choose to skip town for a while until the heat dies down. This takes one of your actions. You can repeat this, if you want... or need. 

If you have Heat, it reduces the Heat Die by three steps (ie. a d10 becomes a d4). If you have Hunted, reduce it by one step. It's not so easy to shake people off once it's personal.

If the whole team is has Heat or is being Hunted (and that will usually be the case), everyone has to Lay Low together. Not much point one of you disappearing off the radar if two others are out partying. 
{{% /boxout %}}


{{% boxout type="action" title="Rest & recuperation" %}}
For one Downtime Action, you can make a normal Natural Healing roll (see SWADE pg 96 for full details). Roll Vigor; success clears a Wound, each raise clears another Wound. Characters with the Fast Healer Edge can make two Healing rolls for a single downtime action.

If another PC is willing to spend one of their own Downtime Actions tending to your wounds, they can Support your Vigor roll with a roll of their Healing skill. Note that magical healing doesn't help with long term recuperation, it can only serve as first aid. See [support](#support).
{{% /boxout %}}


## Getting ahead

{{% boxout type="action" title="Favours for favours" %}}
xxx

Choose a skill, explain how you are using this skill to do a favour for someone important, and roll it at -2. (If it was easy to get ahead in the world, everyone would be doing it.)

You can choose how you want to cash your favour in: good ol' liquid cash, access to extra gear, or even information or some form of service. You don't need to declare this right away, you can hold onto the favour into the next mission and use it at any time. However if you don't use it before the next downtime phase then it disappears. 

| Reward    | Failure | Success | For every raise |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | --------------- |
| LP        | 2       | 5       | +1              |
| Liquidity | 5       | 10      | +2 |

On a critical failure, you earn nothing.

##  Actions affecting your lifestyle

{{% design %}}
This might be a bit too many options / a bit of a fussy design. It depends on if player's feel the lifestyle system is interesting enough to interact with, I think. Needs playtesting.
{{% /design %}}

{{% boxout type="action" title="Live beyond your means / Scrimp and save" %}}
At the cost of one downtime action, you can divert some of your Payout to funding a nicer apartment than you could otherwise afford. Move up one [Lifestyle category]({{< ref "lifestyle.md" >}}). 

Alternatively, if you're happy to live in modest surroundings, you can give up one lifestyle category and receive a bonus action during each Downtime phase.

You can only go up one Lifestyle category, no matter how many meals you skip. But you can go down as many as you like, getting a bonus Downtime Action for each one.
{{% /boxout %}}

{{% boxout type="action" title="Fund lifestyle perks" %}}
If the number of perks you have isn't enough, you can divert funds from your day-to-day living expenses to pay for extra. You'll have to keep money back, though, so you can't afford to do as much as you otherwise would be able to. Hence you have to sacrifice one downtime action. In return you can afford two additional lifestyle perks.
{{% /boxout %}}

{{% boxout type="action" title="Change lifestyle perks" %}}
When your legal life is constructed around a fake identity, it takes some time and care to re-arrange things like leases on property or contracts on outsourced magical security. So changing any of your lifestyle perks takes a downtime action, but you can change any number of perks in that time.

If you start or stop funding extra perks (see the previous action), that doesn't count as a "change" and you don't need to use an action for that.
{{% /boxout %}}


## Helping other PCs during downtime {#support}

{{% boxout type="action" title="Supporting downtime actions" %}}
PCs can use Support for downtime action rolls in one of two ways:

1. A PC can declare they are supporting their teammates in the usual way, ie. they roll an appropriate skill and add successes and raises to the normal roll. This costs the supporting PC one Downtime Action regardless of how many rolls they support -- even if they support rolls from multiple other PCs.
1. A PC can also "take over" a roll for another PC, substituting their own skill in place of their teammate's. This requires  an entire Downtime Action by itself, however.

## Buff actions {#buff}

Actions that give characters a temporary boost or advantage of some kind.

### Carouse


Your character decides to blow off some steam and celebrate still being alive. They spend an extended period of time indulging whatever hedonistic vices most appeal to them.

Take a one-step penalty to your wealth die type  for the next session.

There is no mechanical game benefit to carousing. This is deliberate ;)

### Centre / Hang out?

Character gets Conviction. If unused, this will expire at the next downtime phase.

You spend some quality time with your nearest and dearest. Write a scene telling us what you do together, and take a free point of karma for your trouble! (If you don't want to write a scene, see Train below.)

### Intense training

Your character chooses to focus their efforts on honing a particular skill or attribute. They have to already have the skill -- ie. at least have a d4 in it.

Until the next downtime phase, the character can get a free re-roll on any _failed_ roll for the trait. This stacks with any other re-rolls or bonuses the character might have. Activating the re-roll is a free action.

You can only be trained in one trait at once; if you repeat the action, you lose the previous training.
   
## Side hustle

Shadowrunner's skill sets can be used for more mundane activities than the epic, daring heists we play out at the table. Riggers can do courier work; streetsams can work as bodyguards; mages can provide protection services; deckers can skim low-security systems for paydata.

If your character spends their downtime on a side hustle, they can earn a little extra cash in their pocket. Take a one-off bonus to their wealth die type for the next mission.

You can only do Side Hustle once in a given downtime. 

## Changing the world

### Long-term project

Maybe your character is engaged in some sort of longer-term thing: researching something, making something, trying to create a spell... anything we've agreed upon.

We'll handle this a bit like a Dramatic Task in SWADE or a Clock in Blades in the Dark. You'll have some fixed number of segments to complete - you might or might not know how many, depending on what you are up to. For a single downtime action, you can make a Trait Test using any appropriate skill to work on the project.

Test success will tick a segment on the progress clock. Each Raise will tick a further segment. On a critical failure, you lose one segment. 

### Stash nuyen

Your character is saving up for a rainy day. Retirement? Paying off their dear old ma's mortgage? Up to you. They spend their downtime living thriftily so they can divert as much money as possible to their savings. If you want to work to a specific goal, let me know what it is, and we'll set up a clock to track progress towards it.






## Attune spirits

An attuned summoner mage with the Initiate edge can journey to the metaplanes, explore a new metaplane, and learn its True Name. From then on, they can summon spirits from that metaplane whenever they please. You can do this action multiple times in a single downtime phase if you want.

See [summoning traditions]({{< relref "summoning_traditions.md" >}}).





## Network

You spend time working your contacts, buttering them up, making sure the next time you come calling they'll have the good stuff set aside for you.

Roll a standard Networking test (Persuasion or Intimidate vs target number 4). If you succeed, take bonus LP on the next mission according to the table below. For each raise, take a further bonus LP (again, as per below). You cannot spend Bennies on this roll.

No penalty for failures, but you can't try again; people have had enough of you for now. You can only do Network once in a given downtime.

| Character rank | LP bonus on Success | LP bonus on Raise |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Novice         | +1                  | 0                 |
| Seasoned       | +2                  | 0                |
| Veteran        | +3                  | +1                |
| Heroic         | +4                  | +1                |
| Legendary      | +5                  | +2                |
