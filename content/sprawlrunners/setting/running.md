{{% Pageinfo %}}We find the  way core SWADE treats the running die is rather anaemic and makes it difficult for melee characters to close up on ranged ones in a modern setting. These house rules aim to fix that.{{% /pageinfo %}} 

## Normal movement 

Non-running movement is unchanged; the character can move up to the Pace stat in inches without taking an action. They can intersperse movement with taking their actions freely - for example, moving to take a shot before returning to cover. 

Movement over Difficult Ground or crawling is at half-rate.

## Running 

Running is an action that increases the character's movement distance by their Pace stat. It can be done multiple times via Multi-Actions as usual. Other actions can be interspersed with movement freely. 

If one or two Running actions are combined with a melee attack that _ends the characters turn_, they can take a special +2 "Charging In" bonus on their Fighting roll. This cancels one Multi-Action Penalty. They cannot use this bonus if they continue moving after the attack; this represents the character fully committing to using their momentum to help land a blow. 

A character can run over Difficult Ground at their full Pace, but they must pass an Athletics check at -2 plus any Multi-Action Penalty that applies. Failure results in the character losing their footing; they fall prone and are Shaken.

## Modified Edges

Fleet Foot loses the effect it has on the Running Die, but its +2 to Pace apples to each Running action. 

Free Runner allows movement on Difficult Ground at full Pace without having to use a Running action. It also provides a +2 bonus to any Athletics checks required for running on Difficult Ground.
