Per Sprawlrunners RAW, anyone can purchase an untraceable vehicle with LP; riggers get no special abilities to tune their vehicles. This aims to address that by giving riggers access to a workshop (via an edge) that can be used to boost vehicle stats or outfit them with add-ons.

Mod Points represent access to tools and parts, and are spent like Logistics Points. They can be used to tweak vehicles before the mission, or even during it if the opportunity presents itself.

## New Edges

### Mod Shop

Requirements: Novice, Repair d6+ \
Character gains a pool of 3 Mod Points.

### Improved Mod Shop

Requirements: Seasoned, Repair d8+, Mod Shop \
Character gains a further 4 Mod Points.

### Mod God

Requirements: Veteran, Repair d10+, Improved Mod Shop \
Character gains a further 5 Mod Points.

## Spending Mod Points

All the below cost 1 point each. They can be applied multiples times, but each subsequent application costs +1 mod points. For example, to add +3 to a vehicle's handling would cost (1+2+3)=6 points.

* Increase handling - add 1 to the vehicles handling stat.
* Increase speed - add 20% to vehicle top speed.
* Add armour - add 1 point of armour.

You can also add vehicle accessories. Some of these don't fit on all vehicles eg. you can't put a medium turret on a motorbike or a medium drone rack on a single-seat commuter car.

* 1 point - **gas sealing** - ability to hermetically seal the vehicle. Has a small reserve air supply, typically good for 10-15 minutes.
* 1 point - **small drone rack** - sufficient to launch/land a surveillance or recon drone.
* 2 points - **medium drone rack** - sufficient to launch/land a hunter drone.
* 1 point - **smuggling compartment** - hidden from sight and shielded from scanning. In most vehicles, big enough to hold a couple of rifles.
* 1 point - **off-grid modifications** - extra fuel tanks / batteries, dual-fuel systems, off-road tyres, and other mods to enable use for extended periods in the wilderness. 
* 2 points - **Valkyrie system** - a full smart medbay built into a folding gurney mounted in the vehicle's trunk, with facilities to provide first aid and stabilise badly wounded people. Needs to be the size of a large car or larger. 
* 2 points - **small retractable turret** - up to SMG sized weapon (comes with the weapon).
* 3 points - **medium retractable turret** - up to assault rifle sized weapon (comes with the weapon).

Other mods available by negotiation ;)
