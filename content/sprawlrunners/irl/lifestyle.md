NB: these rules assume dropping the "+5 LP per rank" rule from Sprawlrunners. Instead, progression in the LP a character has comes from their lifestyle and its perks.

If a character modifies their lifestyle by living above or below their means (see [Downtime actions]({{< relref "downtime.md" >}})), they get whatever LP and Liquidity comes from the lifestyle they are living as, not the one based on their rank.

### Low

A very bad apartment in a bad area, or a bad apartment in a very bad area. Expect your utilities (power, water) to be routinely interrupted as creaking city infrastructure diverts limited resources to more desirable tenants.

### Medium

Xxx

### High
xxx

### Luxe

### Itinerant 

This is a special lifestyle for when you (hopefully temporarily) have no fixed abode. Depending on your normal lifestyle level, this might mean you're squatting, living out of a coffin motel, or living it up in a suite at the Ritz-Carlton. 

But regardless of which it is, you're cut off from any lifestyle perks you usually enjoy (although the Ritz has room service, at least) and incidental expenses are eating almost all your Liquidity.
