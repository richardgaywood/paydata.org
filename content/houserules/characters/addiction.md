These rules are **not yet** canon for my current campaign. Although simpler than RAW, they are still too complex, I feel.

## Addiction qualities

(Unchanged from RAW; repeated here for ease of reference.)

1. Mild (4 karma):  If suffering from withdrawal, the character takes a -2 penalty to all tests that use Physical and/or Mental attributes, depending if the addiction is physiological, psychological, or both.
2. Moderate (9 karma): Withdrawal penalty is now -4.
3. Severe (20 karma): -2 to all Social tests all times as the character's degradation becomes obvious. Same -4 when in withdrawal as for Moderate addiction.
4. Burnout (25 karma): -3 to all Social tests. -6 penalty to all Mental and/or Physical attribute tests when in withdrawal. 
5. Beyond burnout: each time a character in Burnout fails an addicition test, they permanently lose 1 point from either Body or Willpower, whichever is higher. 

Dry Addict (also in mild/moderate/severe/burnout levels): must pass a composure test at thresholds 1-5 (depending on stress level) to turn down an offer of the addictive substance. Take a 1-4 dice pool penalty on addiction tests following use of substance.

{{% alert title="Note"%}}
For the purposes of my campaign, I won't be enforcing addiction rolls against soykaf, skillwires, simsense, or foci. I will only roll for addiction to alcohol when the character already has the qualities ie. an existing addiction can get worse but a character cannot acquire an addiction during play.

I've also deleted psyche completely.

Addiction Period is a new field, calculated as RAW's "addiction rating" divided by 3. Recovery Period is calculated as (4-Addiction Period.)

{{% /alert %}}

## Addiction tests

When asked to roll an Addiction or Withdrawal test, the dice roll is:

* Physiological: Body + Willpower vs Addiction Threshold for the drug
* Psychological: Logic + Willpower vs Addiction Threshold
* Both: roll both tests, if *either* fails then the whole test fails

## Risking addiction during missions

If you use any addictive drugs during the mission that you do not have an addiction to, roll an Addiction test as above. If you fail, during the next downtime you will experience **cravings**.

If you have an addiction and start a mission after not indulging in your addiction during the last downtime, you must roll for **withdrawal**. Roll an addiction test as above. If you fail, you take a penalty on all rolls as follows, according to your addiction level, as listed above. This will vanish immediately upon using the substance again.

## Addiction during downtime

### Cravings

{{% alert title="TODO" color="warning" %}}
some sort of roll to see if you get addicted

worse if you are a dry addict
{{% /alert %}}


### Addictions

Addictions place certain requirements on you between your missions.

You can choose to **Indulge** your addiction. This means you will suffer no ill-effects during your next mission. However, you lose a number of downtime slots according to your addiction level:

* Mild - 1 slot
* Moderate - 2 slots
* Severe - 3 slots
* Burnout - 4 slots (this means you will not be able to do a Leisure scene, so will not heal stun damage or recover Edge during downtime.)
	
Instead of indulging, you can **go cold turkey**:

* You will have to roll for withdrawal at the start of your next mission, and take the penalty for withdrawal if you fail.


### Getting clean

To get clean, a character must:

* Successfully go cold turkey for Recovery Threshold downtime phases in a row
* not use the drug during missions 
* make one final successful Addiction Test
* and pay the karma to buy off the negative quality (at full price, so 4 karma for a Mild addiction.)

They can then swap the Addiction quality for Dry Addiction. They do not receive karma for this new negative quality.
