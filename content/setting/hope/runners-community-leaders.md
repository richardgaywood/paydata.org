Lately, I've been considering how to gently steer my campaign away from the "you're just order-following mercs for the corps" angle, and into something a little more punk. Something that encourages my players to use their agency to change the world as they see fit.

One of the best definitions of "punk" I've ever seen is: _you're angry at the state of the world and you're going to do something about it_. Now, to my mind, if we want that attitude to flourish amongst our players, we first need to convince them that the world can be changed.

In other words, we need to mix up our dystopia and season it with a little hope. But how? Here's one idea.

## How powerful are shadowrunners?

A lot of our stories focus on our shadowrunner PCs as being on the lower end of the power range. We follow them as they take on significant threats and deal with serious obstacles -- powerful gangs, armies of wageslave security guards, blood mages and vampires and bug spirit shamans. These are the most dramatic parts of their lives so of course it is where we put our narrative time and energy.

But outside of that environment, we should always remember they are powerful. Next to the local go-gang, the low-level Mafia or Yakuza goons at the nearby watering hole, the fixers and pushers and pimps and all the other low-lives -- next to them, our PCs have _power_. 

So why don't they use it?

## Soft power and hard power

Even a fresh-from-chargen, wet-around-the-ears 'runner has a lot of hard power: enough clout to coerce, intimidate, and threaten to get what they want. A glance over the statblocks for standard NPCs will show a lot of them wouldn't stand much chance if a PC gets physical/astral/Matrix-y with them. 

Quickly, as they get established as trustworthy and valuable assets by various fixers and Mr Johnsons, they'll also accumulate soft power: the ability to co-opt others, to convince them their goals are aligned, the sort of social capital that makes them trusted mediators and mentors. 

"The streets" -- by which I mean the densely networked community of people of various shades of legality that our PCs live in -- is as complicated a political landscape as any corpo boardroom. Who trusts who, who's betrayed who, who owes who a favour, who needs to buy intel, who has gear to sell: these are the currents that move through this network. And the PCs can contribute to this.


## What can the characters _do_?

Most shadowrunners live their lives

I have long been a fan of downtime phases, explicit sections of play between missions where characters can pursue their interests. 






## Shadowrunners in the context of the streets




Consider your Shadowrunners. They probably live in a pretty low-end area; not quite a squatter-riddled slum, but not a _nice_ part of town either. Even if they do have a quiet apartment in a glittering wageslave tower, they probably don't live their lives or ply their trades in the bars and restaurants beneath it. Those are for more conventional people. Our beloved heroes and antiheroes tend to be a bit too... outr√©. Pink mohawks stand out in wine lodges and whiskey lounges.

No; regardless of where their bed is, most Shadowrunners live their lives around the edges of polite society, in the crumbling, forgotten places, out of sight for the wageslave masses. They grow up there. Their friends are there. Their contacts are there. This is where they go to find work, sell paydata, hustle for payouts. 

## The street is made up of predators and prey...

...and sometimes you're both at once.
