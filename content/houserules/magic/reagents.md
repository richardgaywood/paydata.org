These rules are canon for my current campaign.

* increase the cost of reagents, say to 1000 nuyen per dram
	   * _(remove rules for harvesting your own for a bit, they need rebalancing now)_
* remove all RAW uses of reagents (except binding - see the Summoning section)
* add a downtime action to **create a trinket.**

## Trinkets

Trinkets are small objects that are linked to the caster’s tradition or personality in some way and can offer a one-time boost to a magic test. They are crafted by using reagents:

Choose how many drams of reagent to use

1. Choose the trinket’s type (see below)
2. Roll Alchemy + Magic 
3. Resultant trinket has Force equal to the *lesser* of the roll and the number of drams used. Regardless of resulting power, all the reagents you declared in step 1 are consumed.

*Further houserule: I will allow mage PCs to declare they spend one downtime scene creating trinkets, but not which ones. Then they can retroactively fill that detail in via a flashback after meeting with the Johnson to begin the next run. This allows them to avoid analysis paralysis trying to plan for a run they know nothing about.*

## Trinket types

Similar to foci, trinkets can be used to add a number of dice equal to their force to any given magic roll. Unlike foci, trinkets burn out after one use.

* Spellcasting (school) - can aid the spellcasting roll *or* the drain roll on any spell cast from the selected school (combat, health, manipulation, etc). 
* Counterspelling
* Dispelling
* Sustaining (school) - can sustain a spell of the selected school for (Force) Combat Turns. 

## Trinkets on the astral

Unlike foci, trinkets do not have their own aura on the astral; they can be noticed but only if someone assenses your aura (and they can be disguised by Masking in the usual way). Therefore carrying one does not immediately mark one out as a magician to anyone who glances at you on the astral plane; they have a stealth advantage over foci.

## Maximum number of trinkets bound at once

A magician can only bind a number of trinkets at once equal to their Magic attribute.
