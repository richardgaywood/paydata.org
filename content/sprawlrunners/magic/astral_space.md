Sprawlrunners RAW does not use astral projection and significantly limits astral perception.

Our campaign will allow astral projection as a houserule. Astral perception will work like Shadowrun (long distance) and not Sprawlrunners (where it has a very short range).

Adepts - people with only one Arcane Background - can choose to purchase Astral Perception as a power. They cannot astrally project. Full mages - with two Arcane Backgrounds - can both perceive and project, without having to buy any powers.

## Seeing the astral world

* Auras of living things appear like melanges of bright colours in the approximate shape of the person. Sentient beings have a dizzyingly complicated aura of swirling colours; non-sentient ones have simpler patterns but still glow brightly. Plantlife is more muted but still unmistakable. 
* Physical objects appear as flat, opaque, grey shadows. All technological detail is obscured; it's extremely difficult to tell a gun from a commlink. Glass is not transparent on the astral plane.
	* Objects that have spent a long time in proximity to someone who associates them with emotional heft - eg. a wedding ring - carry an echo of that emotional resonance. This slowly fades over time if the object is removed from the person, though.

## Astral projection

A mage can safely astrally project for (Spirit Die/2) hours. 

Beyond that, the mage must roll a Spirit test every ten minutes, at a cumulative -1 penalty each time (so -1 after 10 minutes; -2 after 20 minutes, etc.) When the caster fails a roll, they get 10 more minutes, then if they do not return to their body they will fade away and die.

### Movement

Movement in the Astral has two speeds: 'slow' is Pace 100, 'fast' is 5 km per initiative turn. At the 'fast' rate, everything whizzes past in an incomprehensible blur, so it's really only useful for long distance travel where the mage knows where they are going.

Astral beings can fly freely up to the limits of the manasphere (about 80 km). They can pass through any solid objects but cannot pass through the living earth, however, as that has its own aura.

Astral beings cannot pass through each other. They can pass through the auras of living beings on the physical plane, but the process isn't very pleasant, and the person being passed through can roll Notice to be aware of it (it's like an amped-up version of the "someone just walked over my grave" creepy feeling.)

### Manifesting

Astrally projecting mages can "manifest" to show themselves to mundanes in the physical world. They appear as a hazy, ghostly version of themselves. They can be seen by people, and talk to them.

This is actually a sort of localised psychic link. They don't have a real form, and cannot interact with any physical objects. They cannot be recorded by technological devices like cameras.

Manifesting is difficult, and can only be kept up for ((Spirit Die type) * 5) minutes at a time.

### Losing your body

If someone moves a mage's body while they are away from it, they'll need to make a Dramatic Task to re-locate it before their time on the astral plane runs out!

## Assensing

Roll Astral versus TN4. If the target has the Masking Edge and are choosing to use it, they can oppose this test with Spirit. If the target has Masking and the assenser does not, the Spirit roll is made at +2.

Depending on the outcome, you might learn the following:

* Failure - The assenser doesn't notice anything special. Without masking, the target appears to be healthy, mundane, and be experiencing no strong emotions. If the target is using masking, they can choose to appear however they want.
* Success - the assenser can tell:
  * The target's metahuman race
  * The general physical condition of the target - healthy, injured, or sick
  * If the target is mundane or Awakened of some kind
  * If the target has any cyberware
  * If the target's aura was masked
* Raise - the assenser gets more information:
	* The Wound and Fatigue levels of the target. If the assenser is familiar with diseases, they can often take an educated guess at any serious illness.
	* The power level of an Awakened target, relative to their own (in terms of their arcane skill)
	* The general amounts of and types of cyberware (headware, bodyware, limbs, nervous system mods, etc.)

## Astral combat

This is handled very much like melee combat:

* Attacker rolls Astral
* Defender's Astral Parry is (2 + (1/2 Astral skill die))
* Base damage is attacker's Spirit die
	* Weapon Foci add their die type to this
	* Physical adepts with Killing Hands add their approriate die type
* Astral toughness is (2 + (1/2 Spirit die))
* Apply Shaken and Wounds as normal. Wounds dealt in Astral combat manifest themselves upon the mage's comatose body.

Note that - given how fast astral travel is - the back-and-forth of astral combat can easily cover an area hundreds of meters across.

## Powers in Astral space

Spells can be used between targets on the Astral plane as usual, but an astrally projecting mage cannot cast spells at auras that exist on the physical plane. However, dual-natured beings (like some magical critters or an astrally perceiving Awakened) can be targeted for spells.

unarmed combat does Spirit damage



Astral Projection
Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 0 
Range: Self
 Duration: 2 hours
Trappings: Projecting your soul 
You project your essence into the Astral Plane.  The Ghostly world of Spirits that overlaps our plane and is in some ways a reverse mirror of it, so that the people and places that dominate our reality fade to dim shadows, and the shape of magic and life that may be vague impressions jump to startlingly colorful life. While Astrally Projected your meat body is incapacitated.  Your astral form is invisible and intangible to people in the meat world. Your astral form can fly at Pace 24 and may “run” for 2d6″ of additional movement..  Your Astral form does not have access to any of your gear but does have Astral copies of all Foci you are bonded to.

Assensing
Information gained from examining a target through the Astral Plane. Once a caster is perceiving or projecting on the Astral Plane roll another casting check VS the Target’s Spirit.
Failure- No information gained.
Success- You can tell the health of the target in general terms. You get an impression of the targets emotions and whether they are mundane or Awakened.
Raise- You know the if the target has cyberware implants and their locations. You also know what type of magical ability is being used. You also recognize the subjects aura if you’ve seen it before (regardless of disguises or surgeries).
Two Raises- You know whether their magical aptitude and Essence is lower, equal, or higher than yours. You can also gain a general knowledge of afflictions to the target (diseases, poisons, etc).
Three Raises- You know if the target has any bioware implants, their exact Essence amount and the actual skill level of their magical ability. You also gain acute knowledge of any sickness, disease, or poisons in the target.

When a Magician or Adept perceive in the Astral Plane they are able to use the Assensing ability and also see creatures and magic. A Magician or an Adept can also use spells to damage creatures from that plane of existence (for half damage). All stats go off of physical abilities as on the character sheet. For a Magician to fully interact with the Astral Plane he must leave his body and project his essence there. While on the Astral Plane any spell cast on a creature there does full damage. Things on the Astral Plane happens faster than in the real world, so if combat is split between the Astral Plane and the physical world, resolve what happens on the Astral Plane in a combat round before the physical plane.
While on the Astral Plane treat a Magician’s Mental Attributes as one higher than on the character sheet (this goes for Critters as well). Ignore physical attributes. For resisiting damage directed at the Magician or for critters follow this:
Agility- Use Smarts; Strength and Vigor- Use Spirit.

A Magician’s physical body is helpless while he is on the Astral Plane and can be dispatched easily, so be careful. If a Magician dies on the Astral Plane, his body dies as well. If a Magician’s body is killed while he is on the Astral Plane his essence is trapped and eventually he’ll go insane and become a ghost, wraith, or other type of nasty Astral critter. A Magician can remain in control of myself for the duration of normally being able to be in the Astral Plane. He can also manifest as a spirit on the physical plane during this time and cause havoc or revenge during that time. He can cast spells (still suffers drain) and interact with people during this time.
If a Magician feels damage to his body (and isn’t killed) he can immediately return to his body as a Standard Action. If he is engaged in an activity/combat he must make a Spirit Test TN of 6 to successfully pull his consciousness back into his body.
