## Design goals

First and foremost, to reduce book-keeping and confusion:

1. Remove the need to track anything between phases:
	1. Whether a character has used their Free action
	1. Progressive recoil
	1. How much of a character's per-turn movement allowance has been used
	1. How many actions a character has used outside their phase[^6e-interrupt]
1. Remove all changes to the initiative value during the turn:
	1. No more multiple passes
	1. No more interrupt actions

[^6e-interrupt]: Unlike 6e-style "anytime" actions, which mean a character can use Major or Minor actions outside their normal phase, which means you need to keep track of how many they saved from their last phase.

Second, to make some mechanical/balance changes:

*   Make streetsams/physads more distinctive by giving them combat powers other archetypes cannot access.
	*   Also return to them the ability to frontload a number of their attacks, so they get a natural spotlight moment as they mow down mooks before anyone else can blink.
*   Give AR deckers and riggers an easier time of it -- so they can get out the car/van and come along on the run without worrying that their floppy meatbods will get hurt while they are in VR because thatâ€™s the only way to get a good action economy.

Third, to explore an idea. With the exception of 4e, Shadowrun has always tightly coupled together two concepts: how soon in a turn a character acts (their initiative roll) and how much they can get done in a turn (how many passes they get.) These houserules decouples these and allows them to vary independently under some combinations of character abilities.
