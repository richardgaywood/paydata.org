By default, Sprawlrunners presents a classic '80s cyberpunk take on cyberspace: wired decks and VR hacking. Since 4e, Shadowrun has moved away from this, blending in modern technologies like cellphones and wifi. People have different opinions about how good an idea this is, but I quite like it, so below are some houserules aimed at putting wireless devices and hacking into Sprawlrunners - while hopefully keeping it _Fast! Furious! And Fun!_

*NB I will use Shadowrun-speak in this section ie "decker" not "operator", "host" not "system."*

## Overview of what is possible with these rules

Deckers can use their cyberdeck in augmented reality mode to wirelessly connect to nearby devices: cameras, maglocks, other people's commlinks and smartguns... They can exploit these connections to hack the device and sublety manipulate them: stealing data, listening to phone calls, looping camera feeds, opening doors. Or they can abandon subtlety and switch to cybercombat: crashing devices, flooding them with bad data and 0-day vulnerabilities until they are knocked offline entirely.

People can defend against deckers in a few ways. The simplest method is to form a personal area network, or **PAN**. A PAN groups all their gear behind their commlink, then establishes the commlink as the beachhead connection to the rest of the matrix. Now, in order to hack the devices in a PAN, the decker first has to hack the PAN itself. It's not a lot of extra protection (unless they have a really expensive commlink), but it's something.

Corp wageslaves working in a facility often use a wide-area network or **WAN**. Rather than a weedy commlink, WANs use powerful hosts to safeguard the devices they shelter. This provides a lot more protection. To hack devices on a WAN, the decker first of all has to hack the host; that involves a trip into VR, leaving their meatbod behind as a floppy, vulnerable shell. 

Hosts are also where corps keep their juicy (and valuable!) secrets, so deckers naturally gravitate to attacking them. Those secrets are guarded by ICE and by counter-decker security staff called spiders, so it won't be easy. Hosts can be hacked via wireless connections if the decker can get within connection range, but it's better to find a convenient device the host trusts and use it to establish a **back door** via a wired connection to its inner workings.

With wireless connectivity, deckers also loom large on the modern battlefield. They can use their cyberdecks to run secure PANs (**s-PANs**), which opposing deckers cannot hack by stealth with the decker watching over it. They can host and defend **tacnets**, realtime AR overlays for members of their team that allow them to share tactical information. When the situation calls for **stealth**, they can reconfigure their s-PAN to hide on the Matrix, disguising dataflow between the devices to look innocuous. And finally, they can make powerful **DoS Attacks** against opponents, overloading their electronic gear with junk data to inhibit its functionality.
