## Upgrades

In general, as long as the storyline allows time for characters to go through the necessary surgery, characters may choose to have old cyberware systems removed or upgraded when acquiring new cyberware.

## Eyeware

Mostly as per Sprawlrunners RAW; small changes:

{{% pageinfo %}}
**Cybereyes**

Clarification that all cybereyes provide, by default, approximately 20/10 vision and around 2x magnification without significant degradation in image quality.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Bodyware

{{% pageinfo %}}
**Hand Razors** \
Implant points: 1 (reduced from RAW)

These do not count as natural weapons, and therefore their damage does not stack with Edges like Martial Arts / Brawler / etc. They can be fitted to a cyberlimb, but they do not require one.
{{% /pageinfo %}} 

{{% pageinfo %}}
**Cyberspurs** 

Only available as part of a cyberarm; see below.
{{% /pageinfo %}} 

{{% pageinfo %}}
**Artificial muscle replacement** \
**Muscle enhancement**

*(See Sprawlrunners pg 54)* To clarify: These augments boost the entire body. If the user has cyberlimbs, the base stat of the cyberlimb always matches the rest of the body.

{{% pageinfo %}}
**Wired Reflexes** \
Implant points: N/A (take as an Edge) \
Requires: Seasoned, Smarts d8+, Chromed

**Move-by-Wire** \
Implant points: N/A (take as an Edge) \
Requires: Wired Reflexes

*Cyberware trapping for the Level Headed / Improved Level Headed edges (see SWADE pg 43.)*

A character with Wired Reflexes draws two action cards in combat, and chooses which to keep. A character with Move-by-Wire draws three and chooses one to keep.

**Synaptic booster** \
Implant points: N/A (take as Edge) \
Requires: Novice, Agility d8+, Implanted

*Cyberware trapping for the Quick edge (see SWADE pg 43.)*

When dealt an action card of 5 or lower, you can discard it and draw again; you can repeat until you get a 6 or higher. If combined with Wired Reflexes or Move-by-Wire, you first draw the additional card(s) and pick which one to keep. Then, if it's 5 or below, you draw again.

**Pain Editor** \
Implant points: N/A (take as Edge) \
Requires: Novice, Chromed, Vigor d8+

**Improved Pain Editor** \
Implant points: N/A (take as Edge) \
Requires: Novice, Pain Editor

*Cyberware trapping for the Nerves of Steel / Improved Nerves of Steel edges (see SWADE pg 43.)*

The character may ignore 1 level or 2 levels of Wound penalties.

## Cyberlimbs

To unlock any of the below upgrades and add-ons, you first need to replace the limb:

{{% pageinfo %}}
**Cyberarm** \
Implant points: 0.5 (each)

**2x cyberlegs** \
Implant points: 0.5 (each) or 1 (pair)

+1 Toughness per pair of limbs.

Natural-looking disguised cyberlimbs use the same rules as Sprawlrunners RAW (see pg 55.) In addition, they can only fit **TBD** implant points of mods.

Limb replacements are usually fitted to the shoulder or hip joint, replacing the whole limb. Partial limbs can be taken (eg starting mid-bicep or at the elbow) with no change to game rules.

Cyberarms can be fitted singly. Cyberlegs can be fitted singly if you want a straight replacement, but if you want to fit any additional modifications, you need a pair. It's really difficult to balance a natural leg and a amped-up cyber one for comfortable walking and running.

{{% pageinfo %}}
**Cyberlimb boosted Strength/Agility** \
Implant points: 1

Adds 1 die type to the stat for tests when only the limb with the boosted stat is being used. For example, boosted strength applies to calculating melee damage when the limb is being used to attack with, but not to a test to lift something heavy.

This boost has no effect on skill dice increase costs. *Example: Alice has Agi d8 and Shooting d8, then gets a boosted Agi cyberlimb. It would still cost her 2 skill points to take Shooting to d10.*

If the user has artificial muscle replacement or muscle enhancement, this increase applies on top of that. *Example: Alice has Strength d6. She takes Artificial Muscle Replacement and then adds Boosted Strength to her cyberarm. Her cyberarm now has d10 Strength.*

**Cyberspurs** \
Implant points: 2 (reduced from RAW)

Str+d6 damage in melee combat. Owner always counts as Armed, so never suffers the Unarmed Defender penalty (which grants melee attackers +2 to Fighting rolls if their target has nothing to parry with.)

This counts as a Natural Weapon, and hence the damage increases with use of Edges like Martial Arts and Brawler.

**Cybergun** \
Implant points: 3?

*TBD; probably pick from light pistol w/ autofire, heavy pistol, or flechette pistol.*
{{% /pageinfo %}} 

{{% pageinfo %}}
**Recoil compensation system** \
(Cyberarm only, requires smartlink & smartgun)
Implant points: 1 or 2

A feedback circuit from the user's smartgun to their cyberlimb or limbs automatically counteracts recoil and barrel climb in real-time as they fire.

Reduces the recoil penalty by 1 (for one Implant Point) or 2 (for two Implant Points.)

For one-handed weapons, this will work with only one cyberarm. For two-handed guns, two cyberarms are required.

**Boosted speed** \
(Cyberlegs only) \
Implant points: 1

Increases Pace by +2 and running die by one type.
{{% /pageinfo %}} 

{{% pageinfo %}}
**Hydraulic jacks** \
(Cyberlegs only) \
Implant points: 1

Character can jump twice as far as usual. In addition, they add +4 to damage when leaping as part of a Wild Attack, rather than the usual +2. Can only be used if there's enough room (vertically and horizontally) though.
