Cyberware in our campaign will use a two-track system.

Savage Worlds already has a game mechanic that is very similar to cyberware augmentation, in the form of Edges. Unlike cyberware, however, these are available to any character. This (IMO) goes against the grain of cyberpunk a little - I value the genre trope where the only way to survive involves desperate self-sacrifice, by literally having bits of yourself chopped off.

Sprawlrunners extends the core Savage Worlds edge system to offer an additional catalog of cyberware at different power levels. This is designed to be complementary to core Savage Worlds edges, not to replace them. It does this via a series of three Edges (Chromed, Man and Machine, More Machine Than Man) that give you *implant points*. These implant points can be spent on items of cyberware chosen from the catalog. This approach is a little unusual, but it keeps the game very close to core Savage Worlds, which is good for game balance.

As a houserule, I will be enforcing that a number of Edges can *only* be taken with a trapping that they are cyberware or physical adept powers. This means they are out of the reach of mundane or mage characters. It also, effectively, extends the cyberware catalog. 

Edges taken with a cyberware trapping do not cost implant points, and those taken with a physad power trapping do not cost chi points.

## Edge pre-requisites

The edges that are only available as cyberware or physad powers will gain extra pre-requisites.

For cyberware, before you can take an edge with the cyberware trapping, you must first take one of the cyberware edges per the table below:

| Edge level | Pre-requisite edge       |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Novice     | Implanted                |
| Seasoned   | Chromed                  |
| Veteran    | Man and Machine          |
| Heroic     | More Machine Than Man    |
| Legendary  | More Machine Than Man x2 |

For physad powers:

| Edge level | Pre-requisite edge       |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Novice     | Arcane Background (Physad) |
| Seasoned   | Arcane Background (Physad) |
| Veteran    | Chi Mastery |
| Heroic     | Greater Chi Mastery    |
| Legendary  | Greater Chi Mastery x2 |

Other edge pre-requisites, including those on skill or stats, remain unchanged.
