These are closely based on the rules in [Justin Licht's Savage Worlds / Shadowrun conversion](https://www.pegforum.com/forum/savage-worlds/savage-worlds-homebrew-conversions-discussion/38813-savage-worlds-shadowrun-5e-conversion) (also available [directly on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NM0YIgb0tNVfZm_SjCxk9DL6QulkoVFi).)

Note that these are based around +4 racial attributes per race, rather than the standard SWADE +2. This change gives each race more room to breath and be more closely modelled on the original Shadowrun races. The races are still balanced against each other. I think it also balances against some of the racial traits granted being quite situational or easily replicated with advanced gear in a cyberpunk setting (eg low-light or thermal vision.)

## Human

* Adaptable (4): Humans seem to have an unlimited ability to adapt to their circumstances. 
  * They begin with a free Novice Edge of their choice. 
  * In addition, they can choose one of their Attributes to start at d6 rather than d4. Note that unlike other racial bonuses to Attributes, however, the maximum remains d12 rather than becoming d12+1.

## Dwarf

* Thermal Vision (1): Dwarves see heat. This halves Illumination penalties when attacking warm targets (including invisible beings).
* Focused (2): They are single-minded people and start with a d6 to Spirit (with a maximum limit of d12+1).
* Tough Constitution (2): Their resiliency and natural resistance to toxins and poisons is renowned. Dwarves start with a d6 in Vigor (with a maximum limit of d12+1).
* Short Legs (-1): Being stout and having short legs means Dwarves don’t cover as much ground as the rest of metahumanity. Their Pace and running die are reduced by one.

## Elf

* Low Light Vision (1): Elves ignore penalties for Dim or Dark illumination (but not Pitch Darkness).
* Agile (2): Graceful and quick, Elves start with a d6 in Agility (with a maximum of d12+1).
* Attractive (2): Considered to be the ideal image of desirability in metahumanity, elves are idolized by most and add +1 to Performance and Persuasion rolls.
* Slight (-1): They might be slender and graceful, but they tend to hurt a little easier than other metatypes. Elves subtract one from Toughness.

## Ork

* Low Light Vision (1): Orks ignore penalties for Dim or Dark illumination (but not Pitch Darkness).
* Size +1 (1): Orks are large and tough. Their Strength attribute maximum is increased to d12+1, and they get +1 to Toughness.
* Strength (2): Orks are strong. They start with a d6 in Strength (with a maximum of d12+1).

## Troll

* Thermal Vision (1): Trolls see heat. This halves Illumination penalties when attacking warm targets (including invisible beings).
* Size +2 (2): Toughness +2; max Strength is d12+3 (when combined with Strong, below.)
* Strong (2): Trolls start with a d6 in Strength (with a maximum of d12+3).
* Brickhouse (2): Trolls can take a beating. They start with a d6 in Vigor (with a maximum of d12+1).
* Natural armour (1): Bony deposits on their skin grant +2 points of armour (stacks with anything worn).
* Oversized (-2): It’s not easy living in a world made for smaller beings. Trolls subtract 2 from Trait rolls when using equipment that wasn’t specifically designed for them and cannot wear armor or clothing designed for other metatypes. Their food, clothing, and other lifestyle items are more expensive; they have a penalty of one step applied to their [wealth die]({{< relref "/irl/wealth.md" >}}). They may take situational modifiers when trying to work in cramped conditions that other metahumans would ignore.
* Ostracised (-1): Trolls have suffered the most from marginalization, and are often looked upon with prejudice and stereotyped as dumb knuckle draggers. They often have little recourse other than resorting to crime or security work to make ends meet. They begin with the Outsider (Minor) Hindrance.
* Too Big To Hide (-1): Trolls tend to be terrible at moving quietly and hiding. Can you blame them, they’re huge! Stealth is not a Core Skill (starts Untrained instead of at d4).
