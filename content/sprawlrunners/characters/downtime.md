Every 10kÂ¥ you earn from a run buys you enough time off afterward to complete one of the below Downtime Actions.

## Advance

Spend 10 points of karma to [advance]({{< relref "advancement.md" >}}), as per usual SWADE rules. If you have multiple advances to take, you can take them all as one action; you don't need to spend one action for each advance.

## Carouse

Your character decides to blow off some steam and celebrate still being alive. They spend an extended period of time indulging whatever hedonistic vices most appeal to them.

Take a one-step penalty to your [wealth die type]({{< relref "wealth.md" >}}) die for the next session.

## Hang out

You spend some quality time with your nearest and dearest. Write a scene telling us what you do together, and take a free point of karma for your trouble!

## Lie low

If you attracted an unusually breathtaking amount of attention on the last run, and the wrong people know it was you, you might need to skip town for a while until the heat dies down. This takes one of your actions. In extraordinary circumstances, it might even take multiple actions. Be less obvious next time!

I'll let you know if Lie Low is required.

## Network

You spend time working your contacts, buttering them up, making sure the next time you come calling they'll have the good stuff ready for you.

Roll a standard Networking test. If you succeed, take bonus LP on the next mission according to the table below. For each raise, take a further bonus LP (again, as per below).

You can only do Network once in a given downtime. 

| Character rank | LP bonus on Success | LP bonus on Raise |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Novice         | +1                  | 0                 |
| Seasoned       | +2                  | +1                |
| Veteran        | +3                  | +1                |
| Heroic         | +4                  | +2                |
| Legendary      | +5                  | +2                |

## Rest & recuperation

Each Healing roll takes one downtime action. (See SWADE pg 96 for full details.) Roll Vigor; success clears a Wound, each raise clears another Wound. 

Other characters can Support this roll if they also spend a downtime action. This will usually involve them rolling their Healing skill, for obvious reasons.

Characters with the Fast Healer Edge can make two Healing rolls for a single downtime action.

## Stash nuyen

Your character is saving up for a rainy day. Retirement? Paying off their dear old ma's mortgage? Up to you. They spend their downtime living thriftily so they can divert as much money as possible to their savings. If you want to work to a specific goal, let me know what it is, and we'll set up a clock to track progress towards it.

Take a one-step penalty to your [wealth die type]({{< relref "wealth.md" >}}) for the next session. You can only Stash Nuyen once per downtime.
   
## Side hustle

Shadowrunner's skill sets can be used for more mundane activities than the epic, daring heists we play out at the table. Riggers can do courier work; streetsams can work as bodyguards; mages can provide protection services; deckers can skim low-security systems for paydata.

If your character spends their downtime on a side hustle, they can earn a little extra cash in their pocket. Take a one-off bonus to their [wealth die type]({{< relref "wealth.md" >}}) for the next mission.

You can only do Side Hustle once in a given downtime. 

## Train

You spend time honing your skills. Take a free point of karma.
