## Design goals

With the exception of 4e, Shadowrun has always tightly coupled together two concepts: how soon in a turn a character acts (their initiative roll) and how much they can get done in a turn (how many passes they get.) These houserules explore what happens if we decouple these and allow them to vary independently under some combinations of character abilities.

Other goals:

*   Make streetsams/physads more distinctive by giving them combat powers other archetypes cannot access.
*   Give AR deckers and riggers an easier time of it- so they can get out the car/van and come along on the run without worrying that their floppy meatbods will get hurt while they are in VR because that’s the only way to get a good action economy.
*   Simplify handling initiative at the table: 
	*   Don’t change initiative score mid-turn.
	*   Remove multiple passes.
	*   Remove the need to track recoil across subsequent turns without making it meaningless.
