## Magical edges

Mage characters will need to take one or two Edges in order to become mages. See [Arcane Backgrounds]({{< relref "arcane_backgrounds.md" >}}) for more information.

## Clarification of the Implanted edge

Per Sprawlrunners RAW, the Implanted edge doesn’t cost an Edge point, and once you take it, you can have any amount of zero-implant-point cyberware. This might seem slightly counter-intuitive, but that's because *it only exists to track the effect of these implants on magic users*. 

As such it is functionally equivalent to a rule that says “Anybody can take any amount of 0-cost implants they like. However, mages or shamans with any number of 0-point implants take a -1 penalty to all magic rolls, which stacks with any penalties from the Chromed edges.” 

If you character is not a mage of any kind, you can skip the Implanted edge entirely, as it has no effect on you. If your character is a mage, and you do want to take some zero-implant-point cyberware, that's the only time you need to take it. 

Note that if you take Implanted on savaged.us, it'll use up one of your perk points, as there's no way to zero-out the cost of an Edge on there. So just skip adding it on the site, and only add it to your character sheet later if you need it.

## New rigger edges

The below edges grant Mod Points, used to represent access to tools and parts. They are spent similarly to Logistic Points, and can be used to upgrade vehicles before the mission, or even during it if the opportunity presents itself. See [vehicle mods]({{< relref "vehicle_mods.md" >}}) for how to use Mod Points.
