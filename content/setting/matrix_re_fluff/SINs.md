## What a SIN is

In a society defined by the haves and the have-nots, the sharpest line between them is the possession of a System Identification Number. A combination of citizenship, a passport, voting rights, and taxation obligations, it guarantees you at least some protection under the law and the chance to work gruelling 100 hours weeks until you die. What an honour.

SINs are issued by a wide variety of governmental and extra-territorial corporate entities. They can be granted by birth or by a similar process to obtaining citizenship. Sometimes, corps grant them to particularly desirable hires. Often, corps use the threat of revoking someone's SIN to keep their workers in line.

Physically, a SIN is string of alphanumeric characters. Part of this contains the issuing entity - country or corp - who ultimately controls the SIN. What counts is the data associated with those numbers in various online hosts and datafiles.

## You are your SIN

SINs have become the *de facto* unique identifier in the Sixth World. They are tracked everywhere, both in person and in the Matrix. Every interaction and transaction you have can be tied to your SIN and tracked in some database - and almost all of them will be. Hence every SIN has trailing behind it wakes of data, scattered across thousands of databases. 

The SINless are condemned to a life of misery. They are locked out of legal employment, of reasonable healthcare, even their basic civil rights are reduced. They face a lifetime of grinding for low cash-only wages and paying shady landlords high rent for shitty apartments, and preying that when they get sick there's room at the charity hospital for them. 

This naturally creates a market for fake SINs, anything that might give the hopeless some hope. And, in turn, that creates a market for checking SINs are real.

## Legal SIN verification

It is crucial that the haves protect their stuff from the have-nots. Hence, it is important to be able to verify a given SIN is real and not an imposter. Fortunately for plucky criminals trying to live outside the law, a combination of inter-corp paranoia and mistrust makes checking if a SIN is fake a much more difficult problem than it could be.

There are three broad methods used to verify SINs.

### The global SIN registry

The global SIN registry is a fairly simple database of every SIN, world-wide, attached to some basic biographical information: name, gender, metahuman race, date of birth, and the issuing authority to which the SIN is attached.

Unfortunately, the global SIN registry is only as trustworthy as the least secure entity that can access it, and (by definition) it has to be writable by every entity that can issue SINs. It's a relatively trivial process for the purveyors of fake identities to get enough of a hack against some smaller nation-state to insert fake SINs into the global registry.

So, this is a pretty low-grade check, and easy to fool. Still, it provides enough of a verification to keep out the real low-lifes.

### Be the SIN issuer

If you are the entity that issued the SIN, you have a lot more information about it at your fingertips. If a given SIN is in the global registry but not in your own databases, then ding ding ding, you've caught a faker. This is the sort of check that happens before you take out substantial credit or vote in an election.

Creating a fake SIN that can fool this kind of check is a deep hack against much more secure systems than the global SIN registry, and even then, it won't be permanent. Sooner or later, system integrity checks will find the fake and delete it.

Of course, if you aren't the SIN issuer of a SIN you want to check, you can't do this. The SIN issuers are often secretive megacorps who compete with each other, or paranoid nation-states that are barely on speaking terms with each other. They don't share their SIN details except under exceptional circumstances.

### Online profiling

This is the middle ground.
