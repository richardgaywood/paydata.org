Unless otherwise stipulated, all normal firearms in the game are assumed to be "modern", for a 207x version of the word "modern." This means they have:

* caseless ammo
* electronic firing mechanism
* electronic trigger
* a backup mechanical trigger and firing mechanism
* some internal sensors that enable the gun to track its internal state and display it to the user via an AR holo display (eg. ammo count, current fire mode, barrel temperature, warnings about maintenance schedule)
* optional extra (for more ¥) friend-or-foe ID system [^1]
* optional extra (for more ¥) biometric-based safeties
* "squealer" tags that broadcast the presence of the gun on the Matrix, and track the gun's legal owner (more on these below); also, the same applies to ammo

[^1] Notoriously finicky, and infamous amongst security personally for occasional false-positives that stop them shooting people they really, really need to shoot. Widely hated. Corp execs keep insisting on them, though, because they're micromanaging arseholes. 

### Illegal guns

Any gun the PCs purchase with Logistic Points has been supplied to them through criminal contacts that have already wiped the gun. Squealer tags are disabled (but can be re-enabled if it is helpful for disguise reasons), all other RFID tracking features are disabled, any present biometric safeties or friend-or-foe ID system are removed.

### Squealer tags

If you have a [normal open-carry firearms licence]({{< relref "sins_and_licences.md" >}}), then you are required to have a broadcasting tag on your gun at all times. This tells everyone who wants to know you are armed.

If you have a concealed carry licence, you are legally permitted to disable this broadcast. Criminals routinely do this on their guns, too, for obvious reasons. 

If a cop or a guard spots a gun poking out of your clothes and you *don't* have a squealer tag running, they are going to be intensely curious about you. For this reason, even criminals sometimes turn gun broadcasts on - it can, paradoxically, help you blend in better.

### Hacking modern firearms

Although modern firearms use various Matrix features, they are all secondary to the functionality of the gun, or have purely non-Matrix backup failsafes. Hence, a gun cannot be completely disabled by hacking it.

A decker who wishes to disrupt guns wielded by their enemies can, however, carry out a [Denial of Service attack]({{< relref "combat_decking.md" >}}). This follows the normal SWADE rules for a Test action.
