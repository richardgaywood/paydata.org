Although this overlaps with my [Matrix re-fluff for Shadowrun]({{< relref "xxx.md" >}}) stuff elsewhere on this site, it is signifcantly pared down. The intent, here, is not to contort the fluff to fit baroque existing Shadowrun rules; but rather, to present a straightforward base for wireless hacking to exist in a _Fun! Furious! Fast!_ cyberpunk setting.
