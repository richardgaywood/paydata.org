{{% alert title="Notes" %}}
Shadowrun has long been distinguished by a wide range of magical combat spells, with different strengths and weaknesses. This gives mages some tactical flexibility and trade-offs to weigh up when considering which spells to learn and to use.

In these rules, I am attempting to bring this variety of spells to SWADE and Sprawlrunners, without breaking the system in the process. I've done this by taking an approach detailed in [Gods and Masters](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/298441). Below are some pre-created "bundles" of power modifiers, attempting to simulate some flavour of the trapping in question. For each bundle, these modifers are not optional - they always apply to all powers cast using that trapping.

Mostly, the power modifiers come from SWADE. A few new ones appear, drawn from Gods and Masters.

Each trapping has a total associated PP cost. This is added to the mage's spellcasting penalty in the usual way whenever they use that particular trapping.

Stuff unanswered below:

1. How mages get or choose between these powers. (Easy answer: they learn a power - bolt, or blast, or burst. They can pick a trapping freely each time they cast.)
2. What other Power modifiers can be optionally combined with those below.

## Power trappings

Under these houserules, the three combat Powers - *bolt*, *blast*, and *burst* - are always cast with one of the following trappings. These trappings only apply to those combat spells. Rules for trappings and power modifiers for other spells are as per normal SWADE.

### Wind

*Total: +1PP*

* Invisible (0) - cannot be seen to the naked eye; more subtle than the other spell types.
* Nonlethal (0) - deals nonlethal damage.
* Range (+1) - all ranges are doubled.

### Acid

*Total: +?PP*

* Corrosion (?) - +4 damage vs barriers and gear. Gear is rendered useless, armour loses 1 point of effectiveness.
* Lingering burn (+2) - on the target's next turn, they suffer another damage roll, of one die type less. 
* Splash (?) - adjacent targets (friend or foe) to anyone damaged by an acid power are dealt 1/2 damage.
* Acid attacks work by projecting a stream of liquid acid, which is unusually slow-moving. They can be *evaded*.

### Ice / Cold

*Total: +4PP*

* Biting cold (+2) - inflicts a point of Fatigue if the target is affected by the Power; this cannot cause Incapacitation. This lasts until the end of the next turn.
* Freeze in their tracks (+1) - Anybody affected by the Power reduces their Pace by 2 points until the end of the next turn.
* Ice Shards (+1) - 2 AP.

"Affected" above means the target actually suffered damage. If the damage roll does not exceed their Toughness then the extra effects do not happen.

### Electricity / Lightning

*Total: +2 PP*

* Bypass metal (+1?) - ignore all metal armour. NB: body armour is almost entirely smart materials, ceramic plates, and ballistic weave; it is largely unaffected. However this can often bypass vehicle or drone armour if they have not been constructed with specifc electical dampening protections.
* Conduction (+1?) - if target is soaking wet or submerged in water, take an extra d6 damage. Also applies when used against vehicles, drones, and most gear.
* Unpredictable arcs (0) - if the caster rolls a 1 or 2 on the Spellcasting die, a random bystander is hit instead of the target - friend or foe! Resolve as per the Innocent Bystander rules. This still happens even if the overall spell casting attempt fails.
* Short range (0) - Range is reduced by 5. 

### Water

*Total: +1PP*

* Knockback (1) - targets damaged by offensive water spells must make a Strength check at -2 or be knocked 1d4" away from the caster. Targets knocked into a wall or other hard surface take 2d4 nonlethal damage.
* Nonlethal (0) - water based attacks inflict nonlethal damage.
* Soaked (0) - targets are left soaking wet; they gain resistance to fire attacks (-2 damage) but are vulnerable to electricity (+2 damage.)

### Earth

*Total: +3 PP*

* Armour Piercing (1) - 2AP
* Heavy Weapon (2)

### Fire

*Total: +2? PP*

* Armour piercing (1) - 2AP
* Burning (?) - on a roll of 6 on aa d6, any flammable character damaged by fire magic catches fire, taking 2d6 fire damage per subsequent round. See Fire, SWADE pg 127.
* Light (0) - fire attacks shed a lot of light, which can be good (if you need light to see) or bad (if you're not trying to draw attention.)

### Power

Powerbolt, powerball, and powerburst are magically generated fields of sheer kinetic force. They use the standard power description as written.

### Mana

Manabolt, manaball, and manaburst are special in that they connect directly to the target's aura, rather than

*Total: +2? PP*

* Range is line of sight - including optical-only vision modifiers like binoculars or fibre-optic cables. The mage needs LoS to every target in a burst or ball. Targets within the area but out of sight are unaffected.
* Armour is ignored (+2) - but note that very heavy enclosed armour is bulky enough to envelop and hide the wearer's aura, totally shielding the target.
* Can only target living beings
* The only type of combat spell that can be cast on the Astral plane by a projecting or perceiving mage (but only at an Astral or dual-natured target.)
* Damage is reduced by one die type, ie base 2d4 for Bolt.
* Rather than Toughness, damage is rolled against a similar stat, but equal to (2+(Spirit/2)) instead of Vigor.

### Direct vs indirect

Combat spells fall into one of two categories:

* *direct* spells - the mana flows from the caster to the target via the Astral plane, then "grounds out" to the physical plane through the target's aura. As the mana flows out, it damages the target. 
* *indirect* spells - the mana creates some physical effect at the caster's location; this effect travels on the physical plane to the target's location.
 
### Line of Sight range

As per Shadowrun, most direct combat spells have an effective range of line-of-sight; this is affected by range, cover & illumination penalties as usual. Visual extensions to LoS only apply if they are entirely optical eg. you can cast through binoculars or a mirror, but not a camera.

***TODO**: define range penalties*

### Line of sight and direct area-of-effect spells

Direct spells with an area-of-effect only work when the caster can see all the auras in the AoE. Any aura hidden from them, even if it is within the AoE, is unaffected.
