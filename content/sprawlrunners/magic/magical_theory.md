{{% pageinfo %}}Shadowrun has always kept the ins and outs of magic significantly vaguer than I am going to be here, perhaps in order to cater to different GM's needs. That's fine, but it requires a heck of a lot of words to describe basic things, so I am going to be far more definitive in the name of brevity.{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Mana & astral space

Fifty years after the return of magic to the world, many things about it remain a great mystery to the massed ranks scholars and researches who probe its secrets. Nevertheless, some things are clear. _Mana_ is an energy field that ebbs and flows in a parallel dimension to our own, dubbed _astral space_ or _the astral plane_. Magic is the ability to perceive and interact with astral space, exploiting it as a source of energy to power various effects. This is only available to people with the _thaumetic phoenotype_.

## The thaumetic phoenotype

Approximately 1.2% of the population possess the ability to use magic in some form. Despite exhaustive and well-funded research, the proportion does not correlate with any genetic markers scientists can identify: ethnicity, metahuman subspecies, any genetic marker, geographical history of the subject's family, etc. A minority of studies show a very weak correlation with familial inheritance that hint at a combination of multiple recessive genes but this is hotly debated and far from proven. 

Most crucially, from the megacorps' point of view: there exists no way to predict who will be born with magic capabilities, and no way to influence it by any known pre- or post-natal medical or magical interventions. Gene-editing of the foetus and/or parents; subjecting the foetus to magical fields from time of conception through to birth; artificial insemination of the foetus under a variety of lab conditions -- they've tried *everything* they can think of.

For now, it remains a mystery.

## The thermodynamics of spellcasting

People who possess the thaumetic phoenotype have the capability, with training, to become _practitioners_: people who can wield magic to achieve practical effects such as casting spells.

(Practitioners come in many different traditions, depending on the kind of training they receive. The word "mage" is not preferred as a generic term, as it is too easily confused with the specific tradition of hermetic magicians.)

When a practitioner casts a spell, they reach through to astral space and pull some amount of mana through their own aura and into the physical world. The spell is briefly visible, viewed from the astral, as a sort of structure or scaffold that channels and forms the mana as it flows through. On the other side, in the physical world, it emerges as matter or energy -- whatever it needs to be to create the spell's effect.

The act of opening one's aura to astral space in this way is dangerous. If the spell structure isn't exactly right, the mana flow can overwhelm it; the purpose of the spell's structure is as much to protect the practitioner as it is to shape the mana. An excess of uncontrolled raw power can cause untold damage to the practitioner's body.

## The dangers of untutored magic

{{% alert title="Note" %}}In SWADE game mechanic terms, a would-be practitioner rolling Untrained (ie. `d4-2`) for their Magic skill roll will take backlash on the final value of the roll *after* the -2 modifier has been applied. In other words, a truly naive character trying to cast a full Power will take backlash on a roll of 1, 2, or 3. Hence why Untrained practitioners are extremely dangerous -- to themselves, at least.{{% /alert %}}
