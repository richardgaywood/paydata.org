## Greatforms and minor forms

Spirits are divided into archetypal groups, called *greatforms*. There are six primary greatforms: earth, air, water, fire, beasts, and man. (Some NPC-only spirits, like insect spirits and blood spirits, fall outside this classification.)

Greatform are not spirits that are summoned but families of spirits from which a summoner can draw. Summoners choose from an endless number of variant *minor forms*, each of which is linked to one of the greatforms. For example, spirits of air could be summoned as Tornado spirits, Storm spirits, or Cloud spirits. Each of these minor forms has a statblock and is associated with one of the spirit power levels - lesser, common, or greater.

Greatforms and minor forms are linked to SWADE skills as follows: 

* Each greatform is a separate instance of the Summon Ally power. For example, a hermetic mage might start play with Summon Ally (Fire) and Summon Ally (Earth). Mages can learn more of these through advances, as usual.
* When a mage first learns the ability to summon a new greatform, the player defines the first specific minor form it will take for that mage. This is specific to the character and to their magical tradition, and players are encouraged to roleplay our what a given spirit might mean to a given mage. This involves creating the stats for each minor form at a specific power level - Lesser, Common, or Greater.
* During play, the mage might want to learn more minor forms. A new power, More Minor Forms, allows this; the mage may create two new minor forms for any greatforms they know.

{{% alert title="Example" %}}
Eddie the chaos mage starts the campaign at Seasoned rank. He learns two greatforms: Fire and Man.

Eddie's player Bobby creates two new spirit types that he feels embodies the philosophy of a chaos mage and fit the greatforms Eddie can summon: Blaze (a lesser spirit of fire) and Hearth (a lesser spirit of man.)

Later in the campaign, Eddie advances to Veteran rank. He now gets to create two new common spirits, one for each of his greatforms. Bobby creates stats and powers for an Inferno spirit (of fire) and a Trickster spirit (of man).

Eddie's next advance is used to purchase a new summoning power - Summon Ally (earth). Bobby can immediately create two new types of earth spirit for Eddie to use. He creates a Mud spirit (lesser earth) and a Rock spirit (common earth.)

Now Eddie advances one more time. He takes the New Powers edge and decides to use one of the powers it grants on two new minor forms. Bobby creates their stats; they can be of any of the greatforms Eddie knows (Fire, Man, and Earth), and at any of the power levels Eddie can summon (lesser or common).

Finally, Eddie does one last advance, taking him to Heroic rank. This unlocks greater spirits. Bobby creates three new spirits, one per greatform that Eddie knows. Eddie is really a force to be reckoned with now!

## Spirit chargen rules

For the main, these will follow the rules in the Savage Worlds [Summoner's Circle](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/273484) supplement.

Each greatform at each power level has some pre-defined stats that cannot be altered; the player is then free to spend the rest of the build points (per the Summoner's Circle system) to customise them and create the minor form they will summon.

(I haven't created those statblocks yet. We'll fill them in as we need them, and I will document them here as we go along.)

### Common powers

All spirits have the following powers and abilities. Numbers in brackets are the points value from Summoner's Circle.

* -4 damage to mundane ranged attacks (2): difficult to harm with physical objects alone.
* Dual-natured (1): native to the astral plane; is always astrally perceiving at all times.
* Elemental (5): doesn't need to eat or breath; immune to poison/disease; immune to called shots; ignores 1 level of Wound penalties.
* Extraplanar (-2): can be targeted by the Banish power.
* Fearless (2): immune to fear effects.

### Elementals

Earth, air, fire, and water also each have special minor forms called "elementals", which match up to the boring stereotypes used by dreary hermetic mages. There is no such thing as elementals of beasts or man, though.

Elementals are different from other spirits; they are plodding, incurious about the world around them, less likely to bear grudges if abused by their summoner.

Elementals use the statblocks from Sprawlrunners RAW.

### Servants / watchers

Rules as per Sprawlrunners RAW. 

## Summoning game mechanic

Roll Summoning skill, taking a penalty according to the level of the spirit:

* Servant/Watcher: no modifier to roll
* Seasoned rank (Lesser spirit): -2 to roll (4PP)
* Veteran rank (Common spirit): -3 to roll (6PP)
* Heroic rank (Greater spirit): -4 to roll (8PP)

Take drain on a natural 1 as usual.

Spirit control is based on the concept of *favours*. Each spirit is summoned with two favours by default. Each Raise on the summoning roll adds another favour. If the mage is summoning a spirit of lesser rank than themselves (eg a Veteran mage summoning a lesser spirit), they get an extra bonus favour.

The spirit enters play, materialised on the physical plane, and can act immediately. In combat, they act on the same initiative card as their summoner. Mages can send mental commands to their summoned spirits as a free action.

Any commanded use of the spirit's powers outside of combat uses a single favour. Participation in an entire combat uses a favour. Remote service uses all remaining favours.

By default, summoners can only have one lesser/common/greater spirit summoned at a time. This does not count as maintaining a power, so there is no ongoing penalty to the mage's rolls. They can also keep one servant/watcher summoned.

## Summoning powers

### Banish

*(Slightly changed from RAW.)*

{{% pageinfo %}}
Rank: Seasoned *(changed from Veteran in RAW)*\
Power Points: See below \
Range: Smarts \
Duration: Instant 

Forces other summoned spirits back to the metaplanes. Opposed roll of caster's Conjuration skill versus the target spirit's Spirit. Success leaves the spirit Shaken; each raise inflicts a Wound. If the spirit is incapacitated, it is dismissed from service and returned to the metaplanes.

If the spirit is a companion (see Sprawlrunners pg 17), then it gets to roll the summoner's Spirit in addition to its own (choosing the highest dice, as usual.) Additionally, if incapacitated, it will not be permanently banished, but will return to the summoner's side after 1d4 days.

The power point cost, and hence roll penalty, is determined by the target spirit's rank, similarly to when it is summoned. Hence:

* Servant/Watcher: no modifier to roll
* Seasoned rank (eg lesser elemental): -2 to roll (4PP)
* Veteran rank (eg 'standard'): -3 to roll (6PP)
* Heroic rank (eg greater elemental): -4 to roll (8PP)
