* Add some details about criminal SINs to [SINs]({{< relref "hsw_sins.md" >}})
* Moved a lot of stuff around on the site; there should now be a three-way clean separation between Sprawlrunners rules, Shadowrun rules, and Setting information that is not system-specific
* Moved Matrix setting info to setting/ section; now the Sprawlrunners section only has rules
* Moved this What's New? page to be a top-level site page
* Moved all my old Shadowrun Matrix stuff to the archive section, as it's no longer canon in our campaign and not under development any more
