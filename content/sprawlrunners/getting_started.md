You need two books:

1. Savage Worlds Adventure Edition - the core rulebook for Savage Worlds itself.
2. Sprawlrunners - add-on rules that build on top of Savage Worlds to create an urban-fantasy-cyberpunk setting.

## Philosophical differences between Shadowrun and Sprawlrunners

* Sprawlrunners is a 2050-era setting that is closely aligned with early editions of Shadowrun: no wireless hacking, no technomancers, distinct rules for mages and shamans, etc. 
* In Savaged Worlds, by default, characters start a bit less powerful than they do in Shadowrun, but progress at a significantly faster rate. You can mitigate this by using the "characters start at Seasoned rank" optional rule.
