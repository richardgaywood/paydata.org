Yes, I should flesh out where and how augmentation fits into each class a bit more. I will do so in a future revision!

One thing to add - I don't see the corpos as necessarily intelligent (although I agree they're toting plenty of augments!) They're the people the corp has selected to advance, so they've been "evolved" (so to speak) by the corporate culture. But a sub-theme for me is that hypercapitalism doesn't make good leaders. Its culture is sterile and rotten. Instead, it promotes the kiss-asses, the ones good at padding their budgets reports, the benefits of nepotism, the ones good at taking credit for their underling's work.

The odd corpo is genuinely talented. They're the engineers who can lead a research lab to great breakthroughs; the managers who genuinely inspire their reports; the military strategists who lead battalions to victory in Desert Wars. But these are the rare exceptions. Most of them are just dickheads in nice suits.
