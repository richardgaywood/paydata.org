* [Shadowrun through the ages](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CgYPNt4ZhMIZWSCKbmqyhgrtaNTgRUKdU2iwXH_lczU/edit) - my document that breaks down key game systems (combat, initiative, spellcasting, ...) and compares them, line by line and side by side, in all six major releases of Shadowrun.
* [Which version of Shadowrun should I play?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDo6pfk1BPgKs8Ak16zPqB2gqPYM7gKu-NvAwmlXhbc/edit) - my attempt at answering the thorniest FAQ that any Shadowrun fan community faces.
