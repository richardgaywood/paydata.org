As a general rule, you cannot hide on the matrix. Any smart devices - and this includes many items of gear and most items of cyberware - inherently rely on the matrix to work at all, and so anyone glancing in your direction will see the corresponding icons.

## Hiding an s-PAN

There is an exception. A decker or rigger running an s-PAN from their 'deck can 'hide' it by minimising traffic and disguising the devices within it as innocuous ones. 

The 'deck must be running the Stealth utility. Hiding an s-PAN is also an active, ongoing action that requires quite a bit of attention from the decker or rigger at all times; about half their time, out of combat, and one action per turn, in combat. 

To attempt a successful sneak, roll Hacking (Stealth) against a target number of 4 (if no-one is actively looking for the s-PAN) or opposed by Smarts (if people are hunting for it.) This test will need to be repeated

While an s-PAN is in hidden mode, all traffic between devices is cut to the bone. It can only be used for voice and text comms; no streaming video, riggers cannot Jump In, and most electronic items are only semi-functional (eg. no smartlink or [tacnet]({{< relref "additional_rules.md#tacnets" >}}) bonuses.) 

If combat starts and the s-PAN is still in stealth mode, the decker or rigger can drop the stealth as a free action.
