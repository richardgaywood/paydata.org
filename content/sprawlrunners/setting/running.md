{{% pageinfo %}}We find the way core SWADE treats the running die is rather anaemic and makes it difficult for melee characters to close up on ranged ones in a modern setting. (YMMV on if you want that to be possible, but our streetsams carry katanas, and we like the Rule of Cool.) These house rules aim to address that.{{% /pageinfo %}} 

## Normal movement 

Non-running movement is unchanged:

* The character can move up to the Pace stat in inches without taking an action.
* They can intersperse movement with taking their actions freely - for example, moving to take a shot before returning to cover. 
* Movement over Difficult Ground is at half-rate.
* Moving while Prone (ie. crawling) is also at half-rate.

## Running 

Running becomes an action that increases the character's movement distance by their Pace stat. It can be done multiple times via Multi-Actions as usual, and stacks with further increases to Pace. 

Same as with non-running movement, other actions can be freely interspersed. For example, a character can use one action to Run and one to shoot; move 1/3rd of their overall distance; shoot; then move the remaining 2/3rds.

If one or two Running actions are combined with a melee attack that _ends the characters turn_, they can take a special +2 _Charging In_ bonus to their damage roll. They cannot use this bonus if they continue moving after the attack; this represents the character fully committing to using their momentum to help land a decisive blow. 

A character can run over Difficult Ground at their full Pace, but they must pass an Athletics check at -2 plus any Multi-Action Penalty that applies. Failure results in the character losing their footing; they fall prone and are Shaken.

## Modified Edges

Fleet Foot loses the effect it has on the Running Die, but its +2 to Pace apples to each Running action. 

Free Runner allows normal movement on Difficult Ground at full Pace without having to use a Running action. It also provides a +2 bonus to any Athletics checks required for running on Difficult Ground.
