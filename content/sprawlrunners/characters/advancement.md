Core SWADE has a simple structure for advancement: every so often, the character earns an *advance*. Each advance can be spend on a few things, such as improving traits or new Edges. Every three advances, the character also improves their *rank*, which unlocks new Edges and other abilities. Sprawlrunners doesn't change this structure.

Advances are quite "large", as it were. Each one is quite a significant power boost for a character. It's slightly tricky to work out at what rate to hand them out, as our mission length varies quite a lot and our sessions are quite short.

For my campaign, to smooth over this, I'm going to make a small change, and re-introduce karma from Shadowrun. Karma will be simply spent on advances at a straight 10:1 ratio (ie. one advance costs 10 karma.) This means I can have a slightly more granular mechanic to reward you than just SWADE advances, but it doesn't change any game balance.

## Spending advances

Each advance can be used in one of a few ways:

* Gain a new Edge.
    * Note that mages have access to a Power Edge called New Powers that gives you… new powers. You get to pick two new powers each time you take this, and you can take it as many times as you like. This is how you learn new spells.
* Increase a skill that is equal to or greater than its linked attribute one die type.
* Increase two skills that are lower than their linked attributes by one die type each (including new skills the character didn’t have before at d4).
* Increase one attribute by a die type. This option may only be taken once per Rank. 
* Legendary characters may raise an attribute every other Advance, up to the racial maximum.
* Permanently remove a Minor Hindrance, or reduce a Major Hindrance to a Minor (if possible). With the GM’s permission, and if it makes sense, two Advances may be saved up and spent to remove a Major Hindrance.

## Mission rewards

There are two rewards characters will earn from a mission: karma and nuyen.

I'll typically award karma at a rate of 3-5 per session, depending on how much you get done, and also give out occasional bonus points for cool writeups of downtime actions and stuff like that. (Note: at-the-table cool stuff, like clever strategies, funny jokes, and excellent roleplaying will earn Bennies, not karma. This is to your advantage; Bennies are powerful.)

Nuyen will be negotiated in-game by your characters, as usual. Nuyen is used to cover your lifestyle costs for a while after the mission ends, during which time you can do some downtime actions; see [downtime]({{< relref "downtime.md" >}}) for details. The more nuyen you earn, the more downtime you get.

Note that *nuyen cannot be spent as a replacement for Logistic Points*. See [wealth]({{< relref "wealth.md" >}}) for more information.
