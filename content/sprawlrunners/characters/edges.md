## Edges with required <i class="fa-brands fa-superpowers"></i> augmentation trapping

In my houserules, certain standard SWADE edges are modified to require an "augmentation" trapping. This means they are only available as either specialised cyberware or a physical adept magical ability. These Edges are all listed below and annotated with the <i class="fa-brands fa-superpowers"></i> icon.

NB: for avoidance of doubt: only characters with the Adept arcane background can use the Adept trapping. Mages who take edges with the Bioware trapping suffer the same -1 penalty to magic rolls as if they'd taken one of the Cyberware edges.

The above doesn't effect Implant Point based cyberware, which follows standard Sprawlrunners rules; ie. you take Cyberware edges that grant implant points (see below), then spend those implant points on specific cyberware that grant you buffs and abilities (see [Cyberware]({{< relref "cyberware.md" >}})).

## Edges from other books

A reminder to my players that any Edge from any of our Savage Worlds supplements is a candidate to include in the game. Just ask.

## New and amended Edges

### Background Edges

#### <i class="fa-brands fa-superpowers"></i> Quick

_Cyberware trapping: Adrenaline Pump_. The owner's adrenal glands are buffered by an implanted reservoir. In times of high stress, this reservoir pumps out, flooding their nervous system with adrenaline and super-charging their reflexes.

### Cyberware Edges

These are edges that give a character implant points, that they can (in turn) spend on getting cyberware.

{{% pageinfo %}}
#### Implanted

Per Sprawlrunners RAW, the Implanted edge doesnâ€™t cost an Edge point, and once you take it, you can have any amount of zero-implant-point cyberware. This might seem slightly counter-intuitive, but that's because *it only exists to track the effect of these implants on magic users*. 

As such it is functionally equivalent to a rule that says "Anybody can take any amount of 0-cost implants they like. However, mages or shamans with any number of 0-point implants take a -1 penalty to all magic rolls, which stacks with any penalties from the Chromed edges." 

If you character is not a mage of any kind, you can skip the Implanted edge entirely, as it has no effect on you. If your character is a mage, and you do want to take some zero-implant-point cyberware, that's the only time you need to take it.
