  * reduce to two ABs (adept and mage)
  * one skill used for all spellcasting and summoning - Magic
  * remove spellcaster/summoner split in skills and ABs
  * added [reckless casting]({{< relref "reckless_casting.md" >}})  - spend a Benny to cancel 2 points of penalty on a Magic roll
* Added new [summoning traditions]({{< relref "summoning_traditions.md" >}}) page
  * new rules for *attuned summoners* like Eddie. Attuned summoners can [create their own roster of spirits]({{< relref "creating_spirits.md" >}}) and [learn more spirit types as a downtime action]({{< relref "sprawlrunners/characters/downtime.md" >}}).
