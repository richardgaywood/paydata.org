## Edges with required <i class="fa-brands fa-superpowers"></i> augmentation trapping

In my houserules, certain standard SWADE edges are modified to require an "augmentation" trapping. This means they are only available as either specialised cyberware or a physical adept magical ability. These Edges are all listed below and annotated with the <i class="fa-brands fa-superpowers"></i> icon.

NB: for avoidance of doubt: only characters with the Adept arcane background can use the Adept trapping. Mages who take edges with the Bioware trapping suffer the same -1 penalty to magic rolls as if they'd taken one of the Cyberware edges.

The above doesn't effect Implant Point based cyberware, which follows standard Sprawlrunners rules; ie. you take Cyberware edges that grant implant points (see below), then spend those implant points on specific cyberware that grant you buffs and abilities (see [Cyberware]({{< relref "cyberware.md" >}})).

**TODO**: Add physical adept trappings to the below.

## Edges from other books

A reminder to my players that any Edge from any of our Savage Worlds supplements is a candidate to include in the game. Just ask.

## New and amended Edges

### Background Edges

{{% edge name="Quick" aug="y" %}}
_Cyberware trapping: Adrenaline Pump_. The owner's adrenal glands are buffered by an implanted reservoir. In times of high stress, this reservoir pumps out, flooding their nervous system with adrenaline and super-charging their reflexes.
{{% /edge %}}


### Cyberware Edges

These are edges that give a character implant points, that they can (in turn) spend on getting cyberware.

{{% edge name="Implanted" %}}
Per Sprawlrunners RAW, the Implanted edge doesnâ€™t cost an Edge point, and once you take it, you can have any amount of zero-implant-point cyberware. This might seem slightly counter-intuitive, but that's because *it only exists to track the effect of these implants on magic users*. 

As such it is functionally equivalent to a rule that says "Anybody can take any amount of 0-cost implants they like. However, mages or shamans with any number of 0-point implants take a -1 penalty to all magic rolls, which stacks with any penalties from the Chromed edges." 

If you character is not a mage of any kind, you can skip the Implanted edge entirely, as it has no effect on you. If your character is a mage, and you do want to take some zero-implant-point cyberware, that's the only time you need to take it. 
{{% /edge %}} 

{{% edge name="Chromed" %}}
Required: Novice, Spirit d6+, Vigor d6+

Same as Sprawlrunners RAW (pg 15).
{{% /edge %}} 

{{% edge name="Man and Machine" %}}
Required: Seasoned, Spirit d8+ or Vigor d8+, Chromed

Same as Sprawlrunners RAW (pg 15).
{{% /edge %}} 

{{% edge name="Betaware" %}}
Required: Veteran, Man and Machine

The character has gained regular access to a betaware clinic, which can offer a higher grade of cyberware, more closely tailored to the user's system. They get 2 more implant points.
{{% /edge %}} 

{{% edge name="More Machine than Man" %}}
Required: Heroic, Betaware

Same as Sprawlrunners RAW (pg 16) but you can only take this Edge once.
{{% /edge %}} 

{{% edge name="Deltaware" %}}
Required: Legendary, Betaware

The character has gained access to a top secret black lab that offers the most cutting edge cyberware in existence. They get 2 more implant points.
{{% /edge %}}  


### Combat edges

{{% edge name="Brawler / Bruiser" aug="y" %}}
_Cyberware trapping: Bone Density_. A combination of genetic modifications and implanted engineered glands alters the subject's bone tissue, making it much harder and more dense. 
{{% /edge %}} 

{{% edge name="Hard to Kill / Harder to Kill" aug="y" %}}
_Cyberware trapping: Overclocked Platelets_. Grafted platelet factories are added to the user's blood system along major blood vessels. This greatly increases the body's immediate response to trauma of all kinds.
{{% /edge %}} 

{{% edge name="Level Headed / Improved Level Headed" aug="y" %}}
_Cyberware trapping: Wired Reflexes._ Subdermal conduits augment or outright replace major nerve trunks with faster-acting pathways, boosting reflex response times and speed of movement.
{{% /edge %}}  

{{% edge name="Rock and Roll!" removed="y" %}}
Replaced by [Recoil Compensation System]({{< relref "cyberware.md#recoil-compensation-system" >}}) for cyberarms.
{{% /edge %}}  

{{% edge name="Marksman" removed="y" %}}
Replaced by [smartlinks]({{< relref "cyberware.md#smartlink" >}}).
{{% /edge %}} 

{{% edge name="Nerves of Steel / Improved Nerves of Steel" aug="y" %}}
_Cyberware trapping: Pain Editor_. Cybernetic co-processors installed along the spinal column mute pain signals. Drug glands implanted along major blood vessels respond to excessive trauma by releasing powerful opioid and NSAID analogs. The body's pain response is significantly numbed.
{{% /edge %}}  

### Professional Edges

{{% edge name="Ace" removed="y" %}}
Replaced by [improved vehicle control rig]({{< relref "cyberware.md#improved-vehicle-control-rig" >}}).
{{% /edge %}} 

{{% edge name="Mod Shop" %}}
Requirements: Novice, Repair d6+

Character gains a pool of 3 Mod Points.

Mod Points are used to represent access to tools and parts. They are spent similarly to Logistic Points, and can be used to upgrade vehicles before the mission, or even during it if the opportunity presents itself. See [vehicle mods]({{< relref "vehicle_mods.md" >}}) for how to use Mod Points.
{{% /edge %}}  

{{% edge name="Improved Mod Shop" %}}
Requirements: Seasoned, Repair d8+, Mod Shop 

Character gains a further 4 Mod Points, in addition to the 3 granted for Mod Shop.
{{% /edge %}}  

{{% edge name="Mod God" %}}
