## Actions

* Initiative is determined by card draw. Some Edges let you manipulate this.
* On your go, you can do one or more free actions and 1x normal action.
* If you are shaken, you first attempt to unshake as a free action.
* Free actions:
	* Move up to your Pace stat
	* Speak a couple of sentences
	* Drop prone
	* Drop an item
	* Ready up to two weapons or other items, as long as they are not in awkward positions eg. ankle holsters.
* Normal actions:
  * Running
  * Attacking
	* Supporting allies
	* Testing foes
	* Using a power
* Can do **multi actions**: more than one action on your turn.
	* If you do two actions: take -2 to both.
	* If you do three actions: take -4 to all three.
	* Some Edges and cyberware modify these penalties.

## Combat basics

1. Attacker rolls Shooting skill vs target number 4 (for ranged combat) or defender's Parry score (for melee combat).
2. Roll damage for the weapon type. Ranged weapons are fixed; armed melee are weapon + Strength state; unarmed is just Strength (some Edges increase that).
3. If damage < target Toughness, nothing happens.
4. If damage >= Toughness, target is Shaken. If they were already Shaken, they take a Wound. For each Raise on the attack roll, they take a further Wound. 
5. Target can spend a Benny to Soak damage. Roll Vigor; each Success and Raise reduces damage by one Wound. If they soak all Wounds, they also remove Shaken.

### Common ranged combat situational modifiers

* **Range**: -2 at Medium; -4 at Long; -8 at Extreme. Aim action is mandatory at Extreme.
* **Light level**: -2 (dim) / -4 (dark; can only see 10" distance) / -6 (pitch darkness / target invisible or totally concealed). Can be countered by vision augmentation.
* **Recoil**: -2 if shooting multiple rounds in one attack. Reduced by gas-vent or some other gun mods.
* **Called shots**: -2 for limbs, -4 for hand/vitals/head. Can be used to shoot around armour.
* **Injured**: -1 for each Wound you have taken. 
* **Scale**: from -6 to +10 when attacking objects of different sizes. 
  * Small drones are -2.
  * All metahumans are 0.
  * Most vehicles are +2. 
* **Cover**: -2 / -4 / -6 / -8 depending on how much cover there is. 
  * If the cover makes the difference between the shot hitting and missing, and the cover material could be shot through, then the cover acts as armour instead, rated between +2 and +10.
* **Aiming**: an Aim action before shooting allows attacker to ignore 4 points of penalties due to range / cover / called shots / scale / speed.
* **"The Drop"**: if the defender is *totally* unaware of an incoming attack, the attacker gets +4 to attack and +4 damage.
	* If Shaken or worse from The Drop, character must pass a Vigor or be knocked out. If the attacker calls a shot to the head, this Vigor check is at -2. 
* **Ganging up**: when melee attackers outnumber the attacked characters, they all get +1 to their attack rolls for each additional person they have on their side. Eg. if three people attack one, the three are all at +2. 

## Armour

**Armour**: armour adds its value to the character's Toughness stat, and therefore effects what damage roll is needed to inflict Shaken or Wounds. Their toughness is written as eg. 11 (2), meaning they have 11 total toughness and 2 of those 11 points come from armour.

Some weapons are **armour piercing**: they remove the value of their AP stat from the defender's armour value before the damage effect is calculated.

## Mixing ranged and melee

* **Firing into melee**: on a normal shot, each skill dice that rolls a 1 hits the wrong target. If using a shotgun or firing more than 1 bullet, becomes a 1 or a 2.
* **Using a ranged weapon in melee:** nothing larger than a pistol. Target number for test is the defender's Parry stat. If firing against anyone other than the person they're in melee with, they become Vulnerable.

## Slow attacks and evasion

* **Evasion**: if the attacked character is aware of the attack and it is an attack type that can be evaded, they can take an Agility check at -2; if they pass, they take no damage. 

## Status effects

These are caused by various things happening to you.

* **Shaken**: can only take free actions until you pass a Spirit check or spend a Bennie to cancel the Shaken status.**Note that this makes Spirit an important stat for combat characters.**
* **Distracted**: take -2 on all Trait rolls until the end of the next turn.
* **Vulnerable**: All actions and attacks against you take +2 until the end of the next turn.

## Fancy guns

### Shotguns

Shotguns firing shot give attackers +2 to hit. They do 3d6 damage at Short range, 2d6 at Medium range, 1d6 at Long range.

Shotguns firing slugs do 2d10 damage at all ranges. You don't get the +2 bonus to hit.

### Automatics

Each gun has a rate of fire (ROF) stat. If this is greater than 1, it can fire more than a single shot in each attack. With most guns (but not all), this is optional, and you can fire at a lower ROF if you want.

1. Declare how many shots you are going to take and who you are targeting.
2. Roll one Shooting dice per shot taken, plus one Wild die.
3. Assign the dice to targets however you want. Any single Shooting die can be replaced by the Wild die roll, if you want.
4. Resolve each damage rolls separately.
