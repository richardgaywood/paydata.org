Recoil compensation (RC) mods:

* Airbust link: reduces scatter of launched greande by 2m/hit instead of 1m/hit. Does not function without DNI.

## Smartguns

All guns are one of three kinds:

* Unwired / throwback - no electronics at all
* Standard - limited onboard electronics
* Smartguns - fully integrated electronics with motorised components

### Standard guns

Standard guns, when connected to the user's PAN or cabled directly to goggles or glasses, can use augmented reality to communicate with the user:

* Display an ARO with current ammo count
* Pop-up alert AROs to remind the user of the gun's maintenance schedule or warn of jams
* ARO-enhanced holographic sights

Hacking standard guns has limited effect; it can change or disable the AROs but that's about it.

### Smartguns

Smartguns have a full suite of internal sensors and motorised components.

With DNI to a smartgun, any user gains the following benefits:

* +2 to weapon accuracy due to trajectory computation enhancing the targeting AROs
* Can use mental commands to change fire modes or eject the clip as Free Actions
* Can use a mental command to fire, bypassing the physical trigger (although it typically remains on the gun as a back-up)
* The weapon gains optional Friend-or-Foe detection that works across everyone in the same PAN or WAN and can lock out the fire feature when there is a chance of friendly fire. (Shadowrunners usually disable this, and sneer at people who use it.)
* The same status AROs as normal guns, plus further things like barrel temperature.

However, to really unlock the full potential, the user has to have DNI and also get [the smartlink cyberware]({{< relref "cyberware.md#smartlink" >}}). With DNI to a smartgun (wired or wireless), a user with a smartlink gains:

* Everything in the above list
* +2 dice to all attacks with the gun
* The ability to use [a powerful multi-target attack action]({{< relref "action_economy.md#new-multiple-attack" >}})
