Significant overhaul of design and tech of the entire site, moved lots of content around, updated docsy, implemented new inline zippy sections for design notes and examples, added categories and tags to most pages, started building out a "sprawlpedia" tag for setting notes, etc.

But the most important rule change is [a fresh draft of my magic rules]({{< relref "no_power_points.md" >}}). No substantive changes to the rules, but rewrote text to be clearer.
