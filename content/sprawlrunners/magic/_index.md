description: "Adding 'Universal Magic Theory' to Sprawlrunners"
---

These houserules contain quite significant changes from normal Sprawlrunners. The intent is to give players the flexibility to freely create their own magical traditions, beyond the existing archetypes of shaman and hermetic mage. 

Note that this entire section assumes a reasonable familiarity with existing Shadowrun rules and canon for magic abilities; I won't do a full recap of them here.
