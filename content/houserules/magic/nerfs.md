---

{{% alert title="Status" color="warning" %}}
These rules are **not** currently canon for my current campaign, but they may become so soon.
{{% /alert %}}

* **Normal characters have a maximum initiation grade of 6, and a maximum Magic attribute of 12**. Getting beyond that is out of reach for PCs or normal NPCs (barring dragons, immortal elves, Things Man Was Not Meant To Know, etc.)
	* If it ever matters, I might add in a way for grade 6 initiates to continue to learn new metamagics. Seems unlikely my campaign will need it, however.
* **A mage who takes drain for something cannot heal that drain while the something is still ongoing**. So spell drain and summoning drain is permanent as long as the spell is sustained or the spirit not yet dismissed or disrupted. An exception is binding; once a spirit is bound, the summoner can heal drain as usual. Slap patches still mitigate the effects of drain in the usual way, however.
* The **Focused Concentration quality** (character can sustain any spell of Force equal to their rating or below for free, without the usual -2 penalty) **can only be taken to rating 4**.

## Foci

* **All Foci have a maximum rating of 4**. Add (Force x 3) to all foci availability codes. All nuyen costs are multiplied by the focus Force value. (See below for tables that work all this out.)
* **No action (casting one spell, summoning one spirit) can be affected by more than one focus**. If you have more than one focus that can help (eg. a spellcasting focus and a power focus), you have to pick one. That focus can only contribute to one aspect of the process eg. the spellcasting test or the drain test, not both.
* **Make spellcasting and summoning foci multi-purpose by combining the subtypes**. For example, a single Combat spell Sorcery focus can be used for spellcasting, counterspelling, rituals, or sustaining, however the mage needs at that point in time. However it can only do one thing at once, so if it is sustaining a spell that means it cannot be used for spellcasting while the sustaining is still going. 
	* Additionally, **allow spell foci and spirit foci to offer dice on the drain resistance test equal to their Force**, if they were not used to contribute dice to the sorcery roll.
* The total Force of all bound foci must be less than or equal to 2x the character's Magic rating.
* Remove focus addiction rules.

Idea to discuss but don't yet have full rules for: foci can be attacked via Astral combat. After a certain amount of damage, their link to their user is disrupted. The focus can no longer be used until it is re-bonded to the user in the usual way (ritual + karma cost.)

## Spirits & summoning

* Spirits cannot be ”oversummoned“ ie. you **cannot attempt to summon one with Force greater than your Magic value**. 
* Any Spirit of force 8 or greater can choose to ignore the summons at its option. Expect to roleplay a short scene to convince it to answer your call...
* Spirits no longer get Immunity to Normal Weapons when manifested by default.
	* All spirits that do not have ItNW get an armour value equal to their Force.
	* A summoner can give Immunity to Normal Weapons as an optional power to their combat spirit type. This will take two optional power slots, so is only available on spirits of Force 6 and above.
	* Blight ammo will be fairly rare amongst opponents due to its high cost (250¥ per round.)
* As before, a summoner can only have one non-bound spirit at a time. The total Force of all bound spirits cannot exceed the summoner's Magic rating. 
* Remove the spirit services for Aid Sorcery, Spell Sustain, and Spell Binding.

## Reagents

Remove all reagents and their uses. They are no longer required to bind spirits.

## Enchanting

I believe that, per RAW, the enchanting rules are very weak and uninteresting. They need a ground-up rewrite if they are to be as useful as spellcasting or summoning. 

## Mystic adepts

Mystic adepts, like magical adepts, must choose one of the three magical skills to specialise in: spellcasting, summoning, enchanting. They cannot do the other two.

_Even with this change in place, I suspect mysads are still over powered. This is a start though._

## Reference tables for focus price/karma changes

### Power foci

A Power focus adds its Force to the user’s Magic attribute, and hence all spellcasting and summoning dice pools.

|    	| 5e RAW               	| Houserule version     	|
|----	|----------------------	|-----------------------	|
| F1 	| 6 karma, 18 k¥, 4R   	| unchanged             	|
| F2 	| 12 karma, 36 k¥, 8R  	| 12 karma, 72 k¥, 14R  	|
| F3 	| 18 karma, 54 k¥, 12R 	| 18 karma, 162 k¥, 21R 	|
| F4 	| 24 karma, 72 ¥, 16R  	| 24 karma, 288 k¥, 28R 	|

### Spell or spirit foci (karma/nuyen/availability numbers are the same)

For spell foci: for one school of magic (chosen at time of binding the focus), it adds its Force to the dice pool used for one of spellcasting, ritual spellcasting, or counterspelling. Or it can sustain a spell from the chosen school of Force less than or equal to the Force of the focus. 

For spirit foci: for a specific type of spirit (chosen at time of binding the focus), it adds its Force to the dice pool used for summoning, banishing, or binding that type of spirit. Or it can be used to increase the user’s Magic rating by its Focus rating for the purposes of determining the maximum total Force of spirits that can be summoned at once.

|    	| 5e RAW              	| Houserule version   	|
|----	|---------------------	|---------------------	|
| F1 	| 2 karma, 4 k¥, 3R   	| unchanged           	|
| F2 	| 4 karma, 8 k¥, 6R   	| 4 karma, 16 k¥, 12R 	|
| F3 	| 6 karma, 12 k¥, 9R  	| 6 karma, 36 k¥, 18R 	|
| F4 	| 8 karma, 16 k¥, 12R 	| 8 karma, 64 k¥, 24R 	|

### Weapon foci

|    	| 5e RAW               	| Houserule version     	|
|----	|----------------------	|-----------------------	|
| F1 	| 3 karma, 7 k¥, 4R    	| unchanged             	|
| F2 	| 6 karma, 14 k¥, 8R   	| 6 karma, 28 k¥, 14R   	|
| F3 	| 9 karma, 21 k¥, 12R  	| 9 karma, 63 k¥, 21R   	|
| F4 	| 12 karma, 28 k¥, 16R 	| 12 karma, 112 k¥, 28R 	|

### Metamagic foci

|    	| 5e RAW               	| Houserule version     	|
|----	|----------------------	|-----------------------	|
| F1 	| 3 karma, 9 k¥, 3R    	| unchanged             	|
| F2 	| 6 karma, 18 k¥, 6R   	| 6 karma, 36 k¥, 12R   	|
| F3 	| 9 karma, 27 k¥, 9R   	| 9 karma, 81 k¥, 18R   	|
| F4 	| 12 karma, 36 k¥, 12R 	| 12 karma, 144 k¥, 24R 	|

### Qi foci

_Not currently sure. Might make them the same as power foci._

### Enchanting foci

_I cannot imagine why any PC would ever want one of these._

## Prior art / acknowledgements
Large swathes of these rules owe debt to:
Lormyr for this [post][1] and this [post][2] (see also this [thread][3]) (and this [post][4])
u/dezzmont for [these (quite radical!) suggestions][5]

## Design goals 

* Eliminate the infinite power scaling possibility for mages. Although it’s theoretical in my campaign right now, it still troubles me.
* Reduce the incentives for mages to game the system by casting spells or summoning spirits during downtime then healing up before stuff kicks off. 
* Make it more expensive for mages to get access to higher buffs (of the order of +3/+4 to attributes and +3/4d6 to init.)
* Give mages something to spend nuyen on; elevate powerful foci to be as rare and exotic as deltaware mods.
* Recalibrate foci boosts to fall into the rough envelope of “+1 to +4 dice” that Shadowrun generally applies to various kinds of buff, eg stat augmentations.
* In return, give mages some greater tactical flexibility, eg. by making spell foci more general-purpose.

Something else I'd like to tackle but haven't currently found a way: give physads a different mechanical feel to “samurai, but magic” and also give them more benefit from the (expensive) decision to increase their Magic attribute versus just initiating again and again and taking the Power Point metamagic. I am considering doing this by allowing them to take more powers than they have power points and swap them in and out in a ritual process that takes several hours. This would give them some role flexibility that cybernetic characters couldn't match.
