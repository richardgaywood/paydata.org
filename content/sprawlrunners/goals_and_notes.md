## Why not Shadowrun?

The Shadowrun system is a huge, sprawling beast. For any given edition, the CRB plus splatbooks contain thousands of pages of rules; it's just too much. Like many GMs, I hacked away at it, trying to cut it down to something manageable (see my efforts on the rest of this site) -- but I'd much rather be devoting my energies to running my games than rewriting rules.

Furthermore, these issues are getting worse over time, not better. Shadowrun 6e did little to address the issues of 5e, while having significantly worse editing and organisation.

## Why Savage Worlds?

There's lots of fan hacks around that aim to use other RPG systems to run Shadowrun games with. But for my table's style of game, I think Savage Worlds is a good choice. Why?

* Savage Worlds is a classless system, like Shadowrun. We prefer this to the class-based approach adopted by PbtA and FitD games.
* Savage Worlds is good at pulpy high-action play. Our Shadowrun campaign leans pink mohawk, so that's a good fit.
* Savage Worlds, as a generic RPG engine, has lots of content out there that spans other genres like horror, high sci-fi, and fantasy. Content from these can be pulled in as needed for Shadowrun's more outr√© elements such as metaplane adventures or ultraviolet VR hosts.

## Why Sprawlrunners?

Simply put, Sprawlrunners is by far the most polished and well-considered of the various hacks that attempt to blend Shadowrun's setting with Savage World's ruleset.

It is also probably the adaptation that sticks most closely to the vanilla Savage World rules. For example, the use of (mostly) existing Edges and Racial Trait rules and costs to model cyberware means the game is more easily balanced.

## Why change Sprawlrunners?

Sprawlrunners is perfectly playable as it ships, so why have I written houserules for it?

Well, it's a question of game era. Sprawlrunners has a very classic SR feel, why which I mean the first to third editions. This means:

* Only two magic traditions (hermetic mages and shamans), with a lot of difference between them.
* Wired-only, VR-only cyberspace.

There's nothing wrong with those decisions at all. But they don't work for our table because we already have a pre-existing campaign and pre-existing characters set in the 2070s. One character is a chaos mage, and doesn't fit into the hermetic mage or shaman traditions. One character is a rigger/decker, optimised for in-combat AR hacking. I do not want to start with fresh characters, I want to convert my ongoing campaign. Hence: I wrote the rules you find on this site.
