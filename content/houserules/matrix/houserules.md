If you have User level access:

* Edit file
* Encrypt file

If you have Admin level access:

* Reboot device

## Test resist dice pool for NPCs

Whenever a PC tries to hack something, that something is going to resist. As usual, pool has two parts: one part from an attribute, one part from the device's ASDF stats.

* Attribute: use Host rating or Device Rating.
* ASDF:
	* Device: use Rating for D/F, use 0 for A/S
	* Host: use Rating+2 for D/F, use Rating for A/S (most Hosts are defensively configured, can vary if desired)

This means it's typically one of these outcomes:

* Device Rating 
* Device Rating * 2
* (Host Rating * 2) + 2
