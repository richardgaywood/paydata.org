Lots of changes to magic:

* [Arcane Backgrounds]({{< relref "arcane_backgrounds.md" >}})
  * reduce to two ABs (adept and mage)
  * one skill used for all spellcasting and summoning - Magic
  * remove spellcaster/summoner split in skills and ABs
  * added wild magic - spend a Benny to cancel 2 points of penalty on a Magic roll
