My houserules make some small changes to the available skills in Savage Worlds and Sprawlrunners. Below is a complete reference to all the skills, including the ones in core SWADE. It also has some clarifications of which skill applies to some common actions where it's perhaps not immediately obvious (eg. is a Matrix search Electronics, Hacking, or Research?)

## Specialisations 

A small number of skills have specialisations available. This works as follows:

* When you take the skill, you get one specialisation for free.
* Purchasing extra specialisations costs 1 skill point.
* All use of the skill when one of your specialisations applies is rolled as normal.
* For any use of the skill when you don't have the appropriate specialisation, you take a -2 penalty on rolls.

Specialisations are also available for Common Knowledge. As for other specialisations, they cost 1 skill point per specialisation you take. Unlike other specialisations, they don't change the roll, but they provide considerably more information on a Success or a Raise than if you didn't have the specialisation. The narrower the specialisation, the more information you'll get on a Success. You can purchase as many of these as you want.

If a skill doesn't specifically mention specialisations below, then it doesn't  have any. You can ignore the "add specialisation" button in savaged.us.

## Common skills

All characters get a d4 rank in these skills for free, without having to spend any skill points. You can, of course, spend points to improve them further.

* Athletics (Agility): Running, climbing, jumping, balancing, throwing (including weapons), catching.
* Common Knowledge (Smarts): General knowledge of daily life in the Sixth World.
  * See note above for specialisations.
* Notice (Smarts): Awareness and perception; the ability to spot trouble coming or non-obvious clues.
* Persuasion (Spirit): The ability to convince others to do what you want; via negotiation, orders, or lies.
* Stealth (Agility): The ability to sneak and hide, tail people without being noticed, and spot a tail thats on you.

## Combat skills

* Battle (Smarts): Strategy, tactics, and understanding military operations. Particularly important in the Mass Battles game mechanic.
* Fighting (Agility): Skill in armed and unarmed melee combat. Specialisations:
	* Unarmed (including Killing Hands)
	* Cyber-implant weaponry
	* Blunt (any crushing weapon)
	* Blades (all knives and swords)
	* Exotic (eg. mono-filament whip)

  * Ballistic weapons (bows etc)

* Riding (Agility): A character's skill in mounting, controlling, and riding a tamed beast. Probably not very useful in an urban cyberpunk game! 

## Physical active skills

See also "Athletics" and "Stealth" under common skills, above.

* Gambling (Smarts): Skill and familiarity with games of chance. 
* Healing (Smarts): The ability to treat and heal Wounds and diseases, and decipher forensic evidence. Note that dealing with cyberware systems might also need Electronics and/or Repair, depending on what you're doing.
* Thievery (Agility): Sleight of hand, pickpocketing, lockpicking, and other such dubious feats of legerdemain.
* Survival (Smarts): How to find food, water, or shelter (including in urban environments).

## Social skills

See also "Persuasion" under common skills, above.

*  Etqiuette (Smarts): A character's ability to blend in with the background, carry themselves so they don't stand out, or talk the right lingo to appear to be part of the crowd. Some specialisations are below; let me know if you want more:
	 * Academic
	 * Corporate
   * Organised crime
   * Street/gang

*  Hacking (Smarts): Legal and illegal computer use; coding, programming, and breaking into computer systems. (NB: simple, everyday Matrix actions do not require a Hacking roll.)

*  Occult (Smarts): Knowledge of magical theory, supernatural events, creatures, history, and ways.

See also Common Knowledge, above.

## For reference: what I've changed

* Added some skill specialisation options
* Added Astral and Conjuration to magic skills
* Reshuffled the boundaries between Hacking, Electronics, and Repair to make them slightly more intuitive (to me, at least.)
