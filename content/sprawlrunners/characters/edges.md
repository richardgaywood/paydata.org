## New rigger edges

The below edges grant Mod Points, used to represent access to tools and parts. They are spent similarly to Logistic Points, and can be used to upgrade vehicles before the mission, or even during it if the opportunity presents itself. See [vehicle mods]({{< relref "vehicle_mods.md" >}}) for how to use Mod Points.
