{{% pageinfo %}} 
Action: **Change utility loadout**

See Sprawlrunners pg 39. Takes a couple of seconds to do.
{{% /pageinfo %}} 


{{% pageinfo %}} 
Action: **Jack out of VR**

See Sprawlrunners pg 38. Can be a Free action, but then comes with risk of dumpshock.

The decker cannot "jack out" of AR. That's functionally equivalent to shutting down their deck entirely, tearing down any s-PAN hosted on it.

## Local grid actions


{{% pageinfo %}} 
Action: **Disguise s-PAN** \
Requires: Stealth utility \
Rolls: Hacking (stealth specialisation) \
Use on: your own s-PAN

Used by the admin of an s-PAN to disguise itself and any devices in its s-PAN. This is an ongoing action that takes about half of the admin's character's time and attention to maintain. While this is happening, devices in the s-PAN can only exchange minimal information (text or voice messages), and cannot grant any bonuses.

## Host/node actions




## Rigger & drone actions

Action: **Jump in**

{{% /pageinfo %}} 



{{% pageinfo %}} 
Free action: **Give command**

Give a one-sentence command to a drone or vehicle autopilot. If the rigger is using a drone deck and has multiple drones/vehicles in its s-PAN, they can issue the same command to any number of the drones/vehicles for a single free action.
