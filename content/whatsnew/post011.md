* Moved all cyberware/bioware/adept powers under a new Augmentations section (this was later removed again.)
* Set out the difference between cyberware (bought with Implant Points) and Bioware (not bought with Implant Points; instead, acts as a trapping for pre-existing SWADE edges). 
  * Edges that are available as bioware *require* a trapping ie. they cannot be taken by normal characters / mages.
* Added the following pieces of bioware:
  * Adrenaline pump
  * Pain dampeners
  * Synaptic boosters  
  * Bone density
  * Overclocked / hyperactive platelets 
* Buffed/clarified [smartlinks]({{< relref "cyberware.md#smartlink" >}}).
* Added [improved vehicle control rig]({{< relref "cyberware.md#improved-vehicle-control-rig" >}}).
* Added [wired reflexes]({{< relref "cyberware.md#wired-reflexes" >}}).
