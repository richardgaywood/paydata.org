Add a draft set of [combat magic elemental effect trappings]({{< relref "combat_spell_trappings.md" >}}). These rules are only for discussion at this time and are not currently canon.

Also add insulative armour to [Vehicle Mods]({{< relref "vehicle_mods.md" >}}). And clarify that weapon turret mods no longer come with free weapons (this aligns these rules with Foundry.)
