## Misc

* Speak/text/transmit phrase (Free)
* Observe in detail (Simple)
* Use skill (Complex)

## Movement

Characters move at different rates, measured in the number of metres they travel during their phase.

* **Crawling** (no action used) - prone characters can crawl up to 2 metres.
* **Walking** (no action used) - all characters can walk up to 5 metres[^walking] in their phase without using any actions or taking any penalties.
* **Running** (Free) - characters can quicken their pace to a run by spending a Free action. This lets them move 10+(Agi×2) metres. They will take a -2 penalty to most actions they do during the turn where they are running. (Although note it becomes a +2 to melee combat; the 'charging in' bonus.)
* **Sprinting** (Complex) - characters may travel even faster by spending a Complex action to make a sprinting test (Running + Strength [Physical]). For every hit on this test, most metatypes can travel a further 2 metres than their running distance. Dwarves can only travel 1 metre further per hit, however. They will continue to take a -2 penalty, as for running.

[^walking]: This is deliberately a fair bit less than RAW. My table plays theatre-of-the-mind and we hardly ever have accurate grids during combat. So I wanted there to be a clearer difference between 'walking' and 'running' rates.

### Take cover (Simple) 

Assuming there is some nearby suitable object, this grants the in cover bonus (+2 or +4 to defence rolls) until the character moves again. Note they might get flanked though.

### Drop prone (Free) / Stand up (Simple)

Drop to the ground or get back up again.

### Attacks

All the attacks from the SR5e CRB become Complex actions (but see "New Multiple Attack" below). You can now do as many attacks, during your turn, as you have actions to spend; the only exception is SS weapons, which can only be used to attack once per turn. The Long Burst Fire and SA Burst options are removed. So the attack options now are:

*   Complex actions:
	*   Fire Weapon (SS) _(only once per turn)_
	*   Fire Bow
	*   Fire Weapon (SA, BF, FA)
	*   Throw Weapon
	*   Melee Attack
*   Complex + variable number of Simple actions:
	*   _Carnival of Carnage_ multi-attack (full dice pool; see below)
*   Complex + Free action:
	*   Multi-attack (split dice pool)

Recoil is no longer tracked across turns, but it does apply (in total) across all the attacks done within a single turn. For example, if a character has 2x Complex actions to spend, and uses them to do 2x Fire Weapon (BF) attacks, that's 6 points of recoil that apply across both attacks. When they start their next turn, however, the recoil counter is reset.

### New multiple attack

The old multiple attack rule (use a Free Action to declare, a Complex Action to attack, split your dice pool amongst opponents) remains in place.

If the attacker has:

1. extra physical/meatspace actions and 
1. a smartlink with a DNI connection to a smartgun 

...then they can use a new type of multiple attack, _Carnival of Carnage_.  They can also perform CoC with a melee attack with any weapon, as long as they can move far enough to reach everyone.

To use CoC:

*   It requires one Complex action, plus one Simple action for each additional target in addition to the first
*   Calculate recoil according to the total number of bullets fired and apply it to each roll
	*   Eg. if using 1x Complex and 2x Simple actions to shoot three people with a burst-fire gun, it’s 9 bullets
*   Roll your full dice pool (plus modifiers) against each target
	*   (For simplicity's sake, unless the modifiers are different, just roll once and use the same number of hits against each target.)
