## Hacking hosts via a back door

If a decker can get physical access to debug ports on a device that is connected to a WAN, they can use this to get into the host that is running the WAN more easily. This will usually require a roll of the lower of Electronics and Repair to open up the device and hook up the necessary connections. If the decker succeeds, they take +2 on all actions in the connected node.

Sysadmins are aware of this weakness, and do not usually put external devices like cameras or maglocks onto WANs for that reason. Security WANs tend to be reserved for more serious defences that are harder to get near, like turrets or security guard's weapons.

## Maintaining access to a hacked node from AR

Suppose a decker has hacked into a building facility's security node in VR and now wish to move with the team while maintaining that access.

They can do so via a new utility called **KeepAlive**. This allows the decker to switch to AR while keeping their matrix presence active. They can carry out actions against whichever node they are in as if they were still in VR, although they cannot move to other nodes without logging back in.

The decker has to keep KeepAlive in their deck's memory to maintain the access. In addition, while running KeepAlive, the decker cannot act promptly to defend themselves; all ICE take +2 on all rolls against the decker.
