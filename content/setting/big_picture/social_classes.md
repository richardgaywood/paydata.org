## A quick reminder about SINs

_System Identification Numbers_ or SINs are the single main ID number that a legal citizen is known by; a combination taxpayer reference, voter enrolment, driver's licence, passport, and more. SINs are issued by most of the nations in the world, as well as the largest corporations -- those who have acquired _extraterritoriality_ and so have international rights on the same foot as nation-states. 

Without a SIN, you cannot own a bank account, work, pay taxes, or vote. You have some (severely curtailed) civil rights, but the legal system is not obliged to grant you representation or protection. 

Some people are born SINless, typically because their parents are already in that state. Others become SINless when the corp that issued their SIN withdraws it -- this is a common threat used to keep the wageslaves in line. 

There is a thriving black market in forged and faked SINs, mostly by hacking various databases to insert new entries. Unconvincing fake SINs cost about a week's wages, but provide only a fig-leaf of legitimacy. Convincing ones cost far more.

### The unhoused


### Lower classes

The lower classes make up about 20% of the population and are approximately evenly split between the SINless and those with a national SIN. Their defining characteristic is under-employment and precarity. They juggle multiple menial jobs for cash payments, fighting to get enough shifts to make rent. They are cleaners, taxi drivers, burger flippers. 

They live in shoebox apartments crammed into enormous buildings in poor parts of town. Power and water brown-outs are common. Muggings, burglary, and theft are low; these people have nothing to steal. But violent and antisocial crime is endemic.

The lower classes who are SINless have mostly managed to purchase a low-grade fake SIN. It wouldn't pass any real checks but is enough that unscrupulous landlords and employers will turn a blind eye... but SIN checks in better neighbourhoods mean the SINless are effectively cordoned in place.
