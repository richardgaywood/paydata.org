These rules attempt to simplify the Shadowrun 5e Matrix rules by removing a number of options. For quick reference, some of the changes I have made include:

* Streamline and merge the "AR / VR" and "in host / on grid" distinctions. Now, being "in" a host means always being in VR, and if you're not in a host then you are in AR.
* Split the Matrix into two parts; a localised, short-range, wireless mesh network and a global, wired network. Hacking only works on the former; the latter is ruthlessly protected by GOD agents.
* Mostly remove the concepts of personas and their associated magic unhackable digital ownership.

## Hacking & cybercombat

* Distill all primary decker offensive actions to two kinds: hacking (stealthy, grants access to manipulate devices) and cybercombat (overt, violent, crashes devices.) 
* If a device is in a PAN or WAN, it cannot be hacked directly; the attacker must hack the PAN or WAN instead (this is in Shadowrun 6e, to be fair.)
* If a device is in a WAN, and the decker can get physical access to its internal debug ports, they can compromise it and get a big bonus to hacking the WAN host through it. Hence corps rarely put easily-accessed external devices like maglocks and cameras on WANs; instead, WANs are reserved for stuff like security guard gear and internal turrets and sensors. 
* "Secure PANs" -- PANs that are hosted on a cyberdeck instead of a commlink, guarded by a watchful decker -- cannot be hacked; they must be crashed in cybercombat.
* Via a program on their cyberdeck, hackers who have infiltrated a host subsystem node can switch to AR (to move with the team) but maintain a connection to the node and still send hacking commands to devices attached to it through AR. However, the persona they leave behind is more vulnerable to ICE.

## Wireless off vs running silent

* Wireless devices are always visible on the Matrix - no running silent, and devices connected to PANs or WANs don't disappear from view. Runners doing infiltration work should switch off their wireless and deckers fall back to wired hacking via physically compromising connections and devices. 
* Elimination of almost all wireless bonuses. Almost all PCs gear bonuses unaffected by having wireless off. Corps may use wireless connections for the security, but hardened criminals like the PCs know better than to trust it.
