The Grid Overwatch Division is the Matrix police. **TODO: MORE**

## Overwatch

Overwatch is a 12-segment clock. Clock is public. (Delete: baby monitor program, check OS action.)

The clock ticks up when:

* +1 on any Attack roll, success or failure
* +1 on any failed Sleaze roll
* +1 per combat turn if maintaining user access to any PANs or hosts *after* rolling any attack roll or failing any sleaze roll
	* increase to +2 if maintaining admin access
	* if the intrusion was via a successful Probe / Backdoor Entry, there is a grace period before the clock starts incrementing; see [Matrix actions]({{< relref "actions.md" >}})

The clock resets only when the deck reboots and the decker's persona logs off entirely. The decker loses all access to systems at that time, although any vulnerabilities discovered through Probe remain active.

Once the clock fills, GOD is onto the decker. A Demi-GOD starts tracing them.

At the end of each turn, the demiGOD rolls a number of dice equal to the clock vs a resistance from the decker of Intuition + Sleaze. If there are any net hits, the decker suffers convergence immediately. If there aren't, the number of hits (not net hits) are added to the clock, and the demiGOD will roll again at the end of the next turn.

## Convergence

Same as RAW:

* Persona's deck receives 12 DV of Matrix damage, resisted with Firewall + Device Rating
* Persona is rebooted, erasing all access levels and inflicing dumpshock
* Decker's physical location is traced and reported to authorities (including owners of the Host they were in, if any)

Convergence does not change if the persona is in a host or not when it happens.
