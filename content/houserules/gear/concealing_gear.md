These rules are **not yet** canon for my current campaign.

Taking heavy inspiration from [Blades in the Dark](https://www.evilhat.com/home/blades-in-the-dark/):

* Before any scene, players declare a load level in terms of the table below.
* During the scene, players may dynamically decide that they have brought an item of equipment, subject to limitations as set out below.
* The second column is the penalty or bonus applied to a Perception check for anyone to notice your gear.
	* Note that someone noticing your gear isn't automatically an issue, of course, it depends on context.
* Wearing a lined coat or having a conceal holster at levels Medium or below imposes an extra -2.

The limitations:

1. You may carry **one** piece of equipment at your declared level. For example, if your level is Medium, you can have a heavy pistol or a cyberdeck, but not both.
2. You can carry **two** items of gear chosen from the level below your declared level. So if you declare Medium, and you declare that your heaviest item of kit was a heavy pistol, you might later decide you have two additional magazines for it, or one magazine and a low-rated medkit.
3. You can carry **four** items chosen from the tier below that.

In theory I could keep doubling here, but I plan to handwave it away at some point. Don't take the piss and declare that because you have a machine gun you also have 10,000 knives, or I will engineer the situation so you really wish you had a spoon.

Here's some common items of gear grouped into load levels. Some GM moderation will be necessary to slot other items into this list as they come up.
