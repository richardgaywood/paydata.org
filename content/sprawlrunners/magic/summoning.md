## Summoning powers

### Banish

*(Slightly changed from RAW.)*

Rank: Seasoned *(changed from Veteran in RAW)*\
Power Points: See below \
Range: Smarts \
Duration: Instant 

Forces other summoned spirits back to the metaplanes. Opposed roll of caster's Conjuration skill versus the target spirit's Spirit. Success leaves the spirit Shaken; each raise inflicts a Wound. If the spirit is incapacitated, it is dismissed from service and returned to the metaplanes.

If the spirit is a companion (see Sprawlrunners pg 17), then it gets to roll the summoner's Spirit in addition to its own (choosing the highest dice, as usual.) Additionally, if incapacitated, it will not be permanently banished, but will return to the summoner's side after 1d4 days.

The power point cost, and hence roll penalty, is determined by the target spirit's rank, similarly to when it is summoned. Hence:

* Servant/Watcher: -1 to roll (2PP)
* Seasoned rank (eg lesser elemental): -2 to roll (4PP)
* Veteran rank (eg 'standard'): -3 to roll (6PP)
* Heroic rank (eg greater elemental): -4 to roll (8PP)

spirit powers


When a Magician or Adept perceive in the Astral Plane they are able to use the Assensing ability and also see creatures and magic. A Magician or an Adept can also use spells to damage creatures from that plane of existence (for half damage). All stats go off of physical abilities as on the character sheet. For a Magician to fully interact with the Astral Plane he must leave his body and project his essence there. While on the Astral Plane any spell cast on a creature there does full damage. Things on the Astral Plane happens faster than in the real world, so if combat is split between the Astral Plane and the physical world, resolve what happens on the Astral Plane in a combat round before the physical plane.
While on the Astral Plane treat a Magicianâ€™s Mental Attributes as one higher than on the character sheet (this goes for Critters as well). Ignore physical attributes. For resisiting damage directed at the Magician or for critters follow this:
Agility- Use Smarts; Strength and Vigor- Use Spirit.
