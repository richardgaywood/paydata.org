Stats are unchanged from RAW; Cyberdecks have an attribute array that can be allocated across the four Matrix stats. Takes a Free action to swap any two stats. Remember you can only do one Free action per turn. If you want to do more reconfiguring than that, you can use Matrix Simple Actions.

Cyberdecks are reduced in price to 25% of RAW. See [the gear houserules]({{< relref "electronics.md#cyberdecks" >}}) for more information and statblocks.

## Programs

*Maybe* 

* decrease to ((Deck Rating) / 2) slots?
* add a few more impactful ones?
* add a one-shot +2 dice boosts that burn out after use? (like trinkets) (deckers craft these with Software in downtime?)

### Hacking programs

* **Chaff**: any attempt to Trace Icon against the persona will be inaccurate by (1d6 * 10) metres; if the direction matters, use the scatter rules. This also applies to the tracing that happens after convergence from GOD. (Replaces Cry Wolf.)

## Agents

* Deck can only run agents of a rating equal to or less than the deck rating.
* Agents take a program slot while active.
* Agents have a hardware module with embedded memory chips and co-processors. As such, they cannot be swapped in and out of a deck like other programs. They take a few minutes to connect or disconnect.
* Agent stats are equal to the deck rating, agents use the deck's ASDF, and agent skills are equal to its rating. Hence agents are typically rolling ((agent rating) + (deck rating) \[Deck stat\]) as a dice pool.
* If used to assist the decker on an action, it takes a Simple Action to order the agent to help. Then it rolls its dice pool as a teamwork test. It then takes another Simple Action to order the agent to resume whatever it was doing before, if the decker desires.
* Agents running the same task over and over (eg Matrix perception to watch for nearby icons that are running silent) are not subject to the -1 penalty per repeated attempt as other characters. However, any tests required are always resolved by buying hits on both sides of the test.
