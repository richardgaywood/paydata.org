Deckers can use their cyberdeck in augmented reality mode to wirelessly connect to nearby devices: cameras, maglocks, other people's commlinks and smartguns... They can exploit these connections to hack the device and sublety manipulate them; stealing data, listening to phone calls, looping camera feeds, opening doors. Or they can abandon subtlety and switch to cybercombat: crashing devices, flooding them with bad data and 0-day vulnerabilities until they are knocked offline entirely.

People can defend against deckers in a few ways. The simplest method is to form a personal area network, or PAN. A PAN groups all their gear behind their commlink, then establishes the commlink as the beachhead connection to the rest of the matrix. Now, in order to hack the devices in a PAN, the decker first has to hack the PAN itself. It's not a lot of extra protection (unless they have a really expensive commlink), but it's something.

Rich or well-connected people can also use a wide-area network or WAN. Rather than a weedy commlink, WANs use powerful servers called *hosts* to safeguard the devices they shelter. xxx

Speaking of hosts, hacking them is much more involved than xxx
