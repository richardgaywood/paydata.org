The Grid Overwatch Division is the Matrix police. **TODO: MORE**

## Overwatch

Overwatch is a 12-segment clock. Clock is public. (Delete: baby monitor program, check OS action.)

The clock ticks up when:

* +1 on any Attack roll, success or failure
* +1 on any failed Sleaze roll
* +1 per combat turn if maintaining user access to any PANs or hosts *after* rolling any attack roll or failing any sleaze roll
	* increase to +2 if maintaining admin access
	* if the intrusion was via a successful Probe / Backdoor Entry, there is a grace period before the clock starts incrementing; see [Matrix actions]({{< relref "actions.md" >}})

The clock resets only when the deck reboots and the decker's persona logs off entirely. The decker loses all access to systems at that time, although any vulnerabilities discovered through Probe remain active.

Once the clock fills, GOD is onto the decker. A demi-GOD starts tracing them.

At the end of each turn, the demi-GOD rolls a number of dice equal to the clock vs a resistance from the decker of Intuition + Sleaze. If there are any net hits, the decker suffers convergence immediately. If there aren't, the number of hits (not net hits) are added to the clock, and the demi-GOD will roll again at the end of the next turn.

## Convergence

Same as RAW:

* Persona's deck receives 12 DV of Matrix damage, resisted with Firewall + Device Rating
* Persona is rebooted, erasing all access levels and inflicing dumpshock
* Decker's physical location is traced and reported to authorities (including owners of the Host they were in, if any)

Convergence does not change if the persona is in a host or not when it happens.

## GOD & the megacorps

GOD is run by the Corporate Court and staffed by loaned headcount from all the AAA megacorps. Despite that, the corps do not completely trust it. They worry about a demi-GOD who is loyal to their parent corp using their position to leak information back to them. (Of course, they also attempt to convince their own demi-GOD agents to do the same. In practice, GOD keeps its deckers on very short leashes, so this rarely works - but not never.)

As such, the corps sometimes take measures to keep their darkest secrets outside of GOD's purview. This can include:

* Use of dark fibre connections to send traffic between sites that GOD cannot intercept or inspect. Can be used if the data itself is top secret, or simply to hide the location or existence of a secure facility that would otherwise be betrayed by its present on the Matrix.
* Refusal to alert GOD to hostile decker activity. In game terms, this means the decker does not accumulate OS for hacking attempts in the system. This is not good news for the decker in question, however. It means they are on dangerous ground that will be ruthlessly patrolled by novahot spiders and the blackest of IC.
