## Magical edges

Mage characters will need to take one or two special Edges in order to become mages. These Edges, in effect, unlock a whole skill tree. See [Arcane Backgrounds]({{< relref "arcane_backgrounds.md" >}}) for more information.

## Edges with required augmentation trappings

Cyberware in our campaign uses a two-track system.

Savage Worlds already has a game mechanic that is very similar to cyberware augmentation, in the form of Edges. Unlike cyberware, however, these are available to any character. This (IMO) goes against the grain of cyberpunk a little - I value the genre trope where the only way to survive involves desperate self-sacrifice, by literally having bits of yourself chopped off.

Sprawlrunners extends the core Savage Worlds edge system to offer an additional catalog of cyberware at different power levels. This is designed to be complementary to core Savage Worlds edges, not to replace them. It does this via a series of three Edges (Chromed, Man and Machine, More Machine Than Man) that give you *implant points*. These implant points can be spent on items of cyberware chosen from the catalog. This approach is a little unusual, but it keeps the game very close to core Savage Worlds, which is good for game balance.

As a houserule, I will be enforcing that a number of Edges can *only* be taken with a trapping that they are cyberware or physical adept powers. This means they are out of the reach of mundane or mage characters. It also, effectively, extends the cyberware catalog. Edges were such a trapping is required are listed below.

Edges taken with a cyberware trapping do not cost implant points, and those taken with a physad power trapping do not cost chi points. They are paid for as an Edge, as usual.

### Edge pre-requisites

The edges that are only available as cyberware or physad powers will gain extra pre-requisites. These are in addition to any pre-requisites on rank, trait, or other edges.

For cyberware, before you can take an edge with the cyberware trapping, you must first also take one of the cyberware edges per the table below:

| Edge level | Pre-requisite edge       |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Novice     | Chromed                |
| Seasoned   | Man and Machine                  |
| Veteran    | Betaware         |
| Heroic     | More Machine Than Man    |
| Legendary  | Deltaware |

For physad powers:

**TBD**

<!--
| Edge level | Pre-requisite edge       |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Novice     | Arcane Background (Physad) |
| Seasoned   | Arcane Background (Physad) |
| Veteran    | Chi Mastery |
| Heroic     | Greater Chi Mastery    |
| Legendary  | Greater Chi Mastery x2 |
-->

Other edge pre-requisites, including those on skills or stats, remain unchanged.

## New and amended Edges

### Cyberware Edges

These are edges that give a character implant points, that they can (in turn) spend on getting cyberware.

{{% pageinfo %}}
**Implanted**

Per Sprawlrunners RAW, the Implanted edge doesnâ€™t cost an Edge point, and once you take it, you can have any amount of zero-implant-point cyberware. This might seem slightly counter-intuitive, but that's because *it only exists to track the effect of these implants on magic users*. 

As such it is functionally equivalent to a rule that says "Anybody can take any amount of 0-cost implants they like. However, mages or shamans with any number of 0-point implants take a -1 penalty to all magic rolls, which stacks with any penalties from the Chromed edges." 

If you character is not a mage of any kind, you can skip the Implanted edge entirely, as it has no effect on you. If your character is a mage, and you do want to take some zero-implant-point cyberware, that's the only time you need to take it. 

Note that if you take Implanted on savaged.us, it'll use up one of your perk points, as there's no way to zero-out the cost of an Edge on there. So just skip adding it on the site, and only add it to your character sheet later if you need it.
