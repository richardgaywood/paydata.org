## Banned powers

Note that as per [Powers]({{< relref "powers.md" >}}), the following Powers from core SWADE are removed due to conflict with Shadowrun canon:

* *Drain Power Points* - meaningless in a game that doesn't use power points.
* *Object Reading* - folded into assensing and [the Astral skill]({{< relref "astral_space.md" >}}).
* *Burrow*, *Divination*, *Intangibility*, *Resurrection*, *Teleport*, *Zombie* - contradict core Shadowrun canon.

Only dark traditions can learn these Powers:

* *Puppet*
