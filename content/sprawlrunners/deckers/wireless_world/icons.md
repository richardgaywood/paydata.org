Everything on the Matrix is shown as an *icon*. Icons can represent one of a few different types of entity:

* **Tags**: tiny, passive chips; see [Tags]({{< relref "other_stuff.md#tags" >}}).
* **Files**: any type of data (text, audio, video, computer code, ...), stored on any type of medium (in a tag, on a commlink, in a host, on a storage chipdrive, ...).
* **Devices**: toasters, cars, door locks, speakers, cameras, drones, microwaves, etc etc etc. In the Sixth World, near enough everything that has electrons flowing through it also has a functioning Matrix connection of its very own.
	* **Commlinks**: special devices that people use to see and interact with the Matrix.
	* **Cyberdecks**: souped-up commlinks that can be used to bend the rules of the Matrix by hackers and counter-hackers. There are also **drone decks**, specialised variants used by riggers to control drone networks.
* **Hosts**: the "servers" of the Matrix; big computer systems you can go into in VR and do stuff within. Some hosts are so big that internally they are sub-divided into zones called **nodes**.
	* Hosts contain **personas**, which are icons representing people using the host. Personas can be very simple and generic, or highly customised and tailored to the person they represent. See [Personas]({{< relref "other_stuff.md#personas" >}}). 
	* Hosts also contain **ICE**, intrusion countermeasure electronics. These are autonomous software agents that form the first line of defence against hostile deckers.
