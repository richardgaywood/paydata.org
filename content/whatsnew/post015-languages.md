Added some houserules and setting information for [languages and multi-lingual characters]({{< relref "languages.md" >}}).

The goal is try and keep some flavour of a multi-linguistic, multi-cultural urban sprawl, and encourage face characters to distinguish themsleves through language skills, while keeping the skill point cost to do so under control.
