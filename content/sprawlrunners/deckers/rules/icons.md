Everything on the Matrix is an *icon*. Icons can represent one of a few different things:

* **Tags**: tiny little passive chips. They have no batteries or computing power of their own; they are powered by wireless power gathered from the Matrix. They typically hold and/or broadcast some number of files. They cannot be hacked, as such, as they lack any processor of their own.
* **Files**: any type of data (text, audio, video, computer code, ...), stored on any type of medium (in a tag, on a commlink, in a host, on a storage chip, ...).
* **Devices**: toasters, cars, door locks, speakers, microwaves, etc etc etc. In the Sixth World, near enough everything that has electrons flowing through it also has a functioning Matrix connection of its very own.
	* **Commlinks**: special devices that people use to see and interact with the Matrix.
	* **Cyberdecks**: souped-up commlinks that can be used to bend the rules of the Matrix by hackers and counter-hackers.
* **Hosts**: the "servers" of the Matrix; big computer systems you can go into and do stuff within. Some hosts are so big that internally they are sub-divided into zones called **nodes**.
