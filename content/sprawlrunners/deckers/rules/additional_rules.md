## Commlink defence programs

Occasionally, particularly cautious people might spend some extra cash on defences for their commlink. These all require a commlink of d8 rating or higher; other devices don't have the processing power required. Only one of the following options can be used.

* **Active integrity checking**: the commlink devotes a significant portion of its processing power to conducting internal scans, and a significant portion of its storage to storing known-good states that it can roll back to in an emergency. This provides a measure of defence against cybercombat. The device can use its Hardening stat in place of its Firewall (Matrix Parry) stat. 
* **Encrypted storage**: all files in the commlink's storage are encrypted, with a rating equal to the commlink's dice rating.
