Characters move at different rates, measured in the number of metres they travel during their phase.

* **Crawling** - prone characters can crawl up to 2 metres if they don't want to stand up for some reason.
* **Walking** - all characters can walk up to 5 metres in their phase without using any actions or taking any penalties.
* **Running** - characters can quicken their pace to a run by spending a Free action. This lets them move 10+(Agi√ó2) metres. They will take a -2 penalty to most actions they do during the turn where they are running.
* **Sprinting** - characters may travel even faster by spending a Complex action to make a sprinting test (Running + Strength [Physical]). For every hit on this test, most metatypes can travel a further 2 metres. Dwarves can only travel 1 metre further per hit, however.
