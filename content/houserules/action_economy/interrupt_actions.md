There are two different systems for interrupt actions here; one is the ones we are currently using. The other is a more radical system that uses Edge instead of changing initiative score. These are not currently in use.

## Interrupt actions

{{% pageinfo %}} 
These rules are currently canon for my campaign. Although they are a bit experimental...
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Interrupt actions no longer change your initiative score by -5 or -10 when taken. Instead:

*   A character may save any number of actions unused from their phase
*   These may be used at any point before or during their next phase
*   They can save them to use defensively (eg Parry) or take an action later for tactical reasons
*   The deferred action cannot be held any longer than whenever their next phase is
*   If they are still holding a deferred action when their next phase arrives, they can use it as part of that phase
*   No character can take any defensive actions on the first combat turn before their first phase

Example: Alice (streetsam) and Bob (ganger) are still fighting.

*   Turn 1: Alice rolls 22, Bob rolls 8.
*   On 22, Alice uses one Simple Action to ready her katana. She saves the other Simple Action.
*   On 8. Bob tries to punch Alice (Complex Action.)
	*   Alice can use her saved Simple Action to add to her defence via Parry.
	*   Or she can take the hit.
*   Turn 2: Alice rolls 18, Bob rolls 7.
*   On 18, Alice now has her normal 2x Simple or 1x Complex action, and if she didnâ€™t Parry earlier, she still has that Simple action saved up too. She attacks Bob. 
	*   Note that Bob cannot use Parry, as he does not have any Simple Actions saved up.

## Edge interrupt actions

These rules are **not currently** canon for my campaign. Although I plan for them to replace the rules above in time.
