## A quick reminder about SINs

_System Identification Numbers_ or SINs are the single main ID number that a legal citizen is known by; a combination taxpayer reference, voter enrolment, driver's licence, passport, and more. SINs are an international standard; they are issued to their citizens by most of the nations in the world as well as the largest corporations -- those who have acquired _extraterritoriality_ and so have international recognition as nation-states in their own right. 

Without a SIN, you cannot own a bank account, work, pay taxes, or vote. You have some (severely curtailed) civil rights, but the legal system is not obliged to grant you representation or protection. 

Some people are born SINless, typically because their parents are already in that state. Others become SINless when the corp that issued their SIN withdraws it -- this is a common threat used to keep the wageslaves in line. 

There is a thriving black market in forged and faked SINs, mostly by hacking various databases to insert new entries. Unconvincing fake SINs cost about a week's wages, but provide only a fig-leaf of legitimacy. Convincing ones cost far more.

### The unhoused

Around 5-10% of the population have no permanent residence and no steady income at all. They live in their vehicles, squats, tent cities, or just migrate around the sprawl trying to find whatever corner they can to shelter from the rain. They are mostly SINless, as the threadbare welfare programs for SINners at least keep them from falling this far. They subsist on handouts from charitable policlubs, dumpster diving, panhandling, and the occasional odd job. Substance and BTL abuse is rife as they desperately seek to escape their day-to-day existence.

### The precariat

The precariat make up about 20% of the population and are approximately evenly split between the SINless and those with a national SIN. Their defining characteristic is under-employment and economic precarity. They juggle multiple menial jobs, fighting to get enough shifts to make rent. They are cleaners, taxi drivers, krillburger flippers, soykaf servers. 

They live in shoebox apartments crammed into enormous buildings in poor parts of town. Power and water brown-outs are common. Muggings, burglaries, and thefts are low; these people have nothing to steal. But violent and antisocial crime is endemic.

The lower classes who are SINless have mostly managed to purchase a low-grade fake SIN. It wouldn't pass any real checks but is enough that unscrupulous landlords and employers will turn a blind eye... but SIN checks in better neighbourhoods mean the SINless are effectively cordoned in the places society cannot see them. 

Working patterns amongst the precariat are rarely more than 20-30 hours per week, as there isn't enough work to go around. This leaves them a lot more time and energy to spare than the wageslaves. In many of the precariat, this energy finds an outlet in anger at their lot in life. If a revolution were ever to come, it would start here.

### The wageslaves

The bulk of the population, 60% or so, are the wageslaves: ordinary working stiffs. In a former time, we would have called these "middle classes", and their existence would be characterised as both safe and comfortable. Now, their most defining characteristic is an overworked numbness.

Most wageslaves either work for a smaller corp under a national SIN, or they work for a true megacorp and have a corp-issued SIN. The latter group were either born into the corp or (somewhat less often) were hired into it but had to give up their national SIN in the process. The corp never misses an opportunity to remind these wageslaves that the corp can make them SINless on a whim, effectively casting them out of society.

The wageslave's common working pattern is the infamous "996" -- 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week. Many of them get by only by abusing advanced stimulants and, for those lucky to afford it, sleep regulators. Outside of work, they mostly immerse themselves in consumerism, sports, social media, gaming -- anything to distract and numb themselves. This is how the powers that be prefer it.

### The corpos

The difference between a wageslave and a corpo-in-the-making is belief: the corpos are the true believers in the corp's mission, the ones prepared to dedicate their lives to not just existing inside the corp but _advancing_. This almost inevitably involves total moral compromise. In return, they get a life of genuine comfort and some actual measure of security. They largely escape the soul crushing 996 working pattern, usually by concocting excuses to leave the office like offsite meetings. 

Corpos make up around 10% of the population. Some of them start as wageslaves, and claw themselves upward on merit and a callous willingness to do what it takes. Most, however, are born into it: the sons and daughters of other corpos, groomed from an early age. Nepotism is rife in the megacorps.
