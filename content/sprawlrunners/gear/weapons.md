### Modifications

These are intrinsic to the weapon when it is purchased. Below are some houseruled additions to the standard ones list in Sprawlrunners (pg 56):

* Revolver: reduced shots (already reflected in statline). If it is a smartgun, character can load different ammo types in different cylinders, and choose which cylinders to fire for each attack via a mental command as a free action. Plus swinging the gate open to dump spent brass is extremely cool.
* Heavy calibre: applies +1 AP, requires 1 more die type in Str. Costs +1LP.
* Extended mag: +33% shots, +1LP, +2 to Notice due to the weapon's awkward, bulky shape.

## Accessories

* Smartgun (houserule version): subtracts 2 points of penalties from a Shooting role *or* adds 1 to the roll. (+1LP to weapon cost)

## Cosmetic trappings

* *Imposing* - oversized; bulky; threatening.
* *Blinged* - made of mirror-polished chrome; colour-changing smartpaint; public AR broadcast of a killcount holo.
* *Sleek* - matte black; no protrusions; militaristic and efficient.
* *Tacticool* - thinks it is *sleek* but is actually covered in superfluous grips, accessory ports, flashlights, and other junk only valued by poseurs.
* *Sci-fi* - weird shapes; modern smart materials; sculpted to look bio-organic; covered in neon lights.
* *Double-barrelled* - has two barrels (shock).
