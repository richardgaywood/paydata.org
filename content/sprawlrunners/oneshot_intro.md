## Savage Worlds five minute tour

_See also [this rule summary on Up To Four Players](https://www.uptofourplayers.com/ready-to-roll/savage-worlds-rules/)!_

**Core dice mechanic**: Attributes and Skills are collectively called Traits. Traits have a die type as a stat (d4 to d12). Players roll the die for their Trait, plus an extra d6 called the _Wild die_. Dice explode and keep adding onto the total when their maximum value is rolled. Whichever of the Trait die and the Wild die rolls highest is kept and compared to a target number. Equalling or beating the target number is a _success_; beating it by 4 or more is a _raise_. Sometimes we also count how many raises you get.

* The standard target number for an averagely difficult task is 4. 
* Lesser NPCs don't get Wild die, only powerful/named ones do.

**Combat resolution**: roll your Fighting, Shooting, or Athletics (for thrown weapons) Trait against a target number set by either the weapon range or the opponent's Parry stat. If you succeed, roll the weapon's damage and compare to the target's Toughness stat. If you roll higher, the target will be Shaken (briefly stunned) or Wounded. 

* If the attack roll result is a raise, you can roll an extra d6 on the damage.
* Damage dice also explode!

**Bennies**: these are Savage Worlds' meta-currency. You start play with some, and the GM gives you more for doing cool stuff, roleplaying well, etc. You can use them to reroll dice, attempt to Soak (negate) incoming damage, influence the plot, and more.

* If you see another player do something that deserves a Bennie but I haven't given them one, tell me so I can fix that!

## Shadowrun

_The year is 2071. The world has changed, some say Awakened._

<!-- 2072 - 4e20A -->

{{% alert title="Notes" %}}Shadowrun canon contains a staggering – stifling, even – amount of lore. It's hopeless to try and navigate it in a one-shot. This section contains an extremely short summary to try and give you the feel for it. But know that as a player at my table, you're empowered to make up anything you want -- to make your character work, to make some plot point work, whatever. I value collaboration over canonicity.{{% /alert %}}
