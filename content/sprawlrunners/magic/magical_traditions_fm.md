## Overview of rules structure

Each tradition gets:

* Signature power(s): _these are somehow improved_
* Removed power(s): powers the given tradition cannot use.
* Spirit types: the types of spirit they can summon  

## Disallowed powers

All powers in SWADE (pgs 154--171) are allowed, *except* the following:

* Drain Power Points - meaningless in a game that doesn't use power points.
* Object Reading - folded into assensing and the Astral skill.
* Burrow, Divination, Intangibility, Resurrection, Teleport, Zombie - contradict core Shadowrun canon and/or are a bit of an "I win!" button.
* Mind Control, Puppet, Mind Reading (_more?_)- only available to certain mages.

## The Magic skill

For simplicity, I am going to use just one skill for all the traditions and call it "Magic". If you prefer a more SWADE-y approach, you can rename it on a per-tradition basis, eg. using Faith for the divinity-derived ones.

There are two variants of the Magic skill: one based on Spirit and one based on Smarts. Different traditions use different variants.

## The traditions

### Hermetic mages



### Divinity

### Gaia

### Chaos
