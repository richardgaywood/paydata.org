*RAW Sprawlrunners offers three types of Arcane Background - hermetic mage, shaman, and qi adept (same as physical adepts in Shadowrun). This reflects an approach similar to Shadowrun 1e/2e, where hermetic mages and shamans had very different rule mechanics, but other magical traditions were rather less fleshed out.*

*I wish to adopt an approach closer to Shadowrun from 4e onwards; what is often called "unified magic theory." Bring the rules for different magical traditions into closer alignment, then use that as a springboard to make it easier to add new magic traditions. My ultimate goal is to allow players the freedom to define their own traditions, and how their characters interpret them.*

For my game, I am using two Arcane Backgrounds for PCs:

* AB(physad) - the classic Shadowrun physical adept. Doesn't have an arcane power skill. Rules are the same as Sprawlrunners RAW.
* AB(mage) - shamans, hermetic mages, chaos mages, etc etc. All types of "normal" mages. The arcane power skill is Magic, which comes in two variants; one linked to Smarts, one linked to Spirit. More on that below.

Mages start play with **three** free Powers, and can get more via the New Powers Edge, as usual.

## The Magic skill

There are two variants of this skill, linked to different attributes, reflecting that different magic users have different ways to interact with mana:

* magic users like shamans, houngans, or chaos mages -- whose approach to magic works on an artistic, instinctive, or naturalistic level -- use Magic (Spirit).
* magic users like hermetic mages or Catholic thaumaturgists -- whose approach to magic is more scientific, rigorous, or based on theoretical study -- use Magic (Smarts).

For avoidance of doubt: the only difference between Magic (Spirit) and (Smarts) is the role-playing aspect and the choice of linked attribute for the skill. Everything else is the same â€“ [available power list]({{< relref "powers.md" >}}), drain rules, etc.

*The only reason  I'm calling this "Magic" when it's called "Spellcasting" in core SWADE is that it bothers me that a skill called "Spellcasting" is used to summon spirits. Coming from Shadowrun, that feels really jarring. It's the same skill, though, just renamed.*

### Wild magic (houserule)

Normal magic involves carefully constructing a structure in astral space to draw the magic through. This helps prevent damage to the mage from wielding the mana, and when Drain does occur, its effects on the body are limited.

If the chips are down, any mage may choose to spend a Bennie to instead use wild magic, drawing mana directly into their own aura. The extra power surge allows them to cancel up to 2 points of penalty to the roll (which stacks with any other similar penalty-cancellation effect.) However, if they take Drain, then it will be a Wound rather than Fatigue.

If you roll a Critical Failure on a wild magic casting, you should expect *significant* problems to occur...

*NoPP casters get a slightly raw deal in SWADE, with a number of options removed compared to Power Point casters. In particular, PP casters can access the "spend a Bennie to get +5 PP" option when they are running low on juice. The above rule is intended to offer a similar option to NoPP casters, albeit with some setting-appropriate risk of drain.*

## Astral space

Any character with AB(mage) gets a free Astral Projection power. Adept characters can purchase Astral Perception for 1 Chi Point. Activities on the Astral plane, including assensing and astral combat, are governed by the new Astral (Smarts) skill.

<!--Assensing auras on the Astral plane is a Notice roll. Engaging in Astral combat is a Magic roll. -->

See [Astral Space]({{< relref "astral_space.md" >}}) for more details.

## Mystic adepts

I have not yet fleshed out rules for mystic adepts - characters who combine physad abilities with limited magic abilities. I think this is best modelled by giving physads some ability to learn Powers, similar to the Power racial trait (see SWADE pg 19.) Let me know if you want to play such a character in my campaign and we'll figure it out.

## NPC-only arcane backgrounds

I have some ideas for how to handle magical traditions that are used for various types of NPCs, although these are not yet fully fleshed out:

* AB(critter) - used for any paracritters that have Powers. Comes with a Magic skill that is rolled as normal to determine power effect. Critters do not take drain, as their magical abilities are inherent to them.
* AB(toxic) and AB(blood) - toxic mages and blood mages are able to draw on reserves of power outside their own body. In addition to the normal spellcasting rules, they also have a pool of Power Points, and can use those to cast spells in accordance with normal SWADE rules. These spells do not have the usual negative roll modifier for the No Power Points rule. However, these dark magics come with a price; all Drain causes Wounds rather than Fatigue.

## Spellcaster

Most of the powers listed in SWADE are available equally to both kinds of spellcaster arcane backgrounds. The arcane background comes with three starting powers at chargen; these powers are broadly equivalent to spells in Shadowrun. Almost all the Powers in SWADE are applicable here, but note that Summon Ally and Banish move to the Summoner Arcane Background (see below).

You can gain more powers after chargen by using advances to purchase the "More Powers" edge. Each time you take this, you get two new powers.

See [Spellcasting]({{< relref "spellcasting/_index.md" >}}) for full details.

## Summoner

The Summoner arcane background only has three powers associated with it, two from core SWADE and one new one:

* *Summon Ally (greatform)*: used to summon spirits. Can be taken multiple times. Each version of it is specific to one greatform spirit.
* *Banish*: used to banish other people's summoned spirits. In a change from SWADE core rules, this is available at Seasoned rank and above.
* *New minor forms*: unlocks more spirit minor forms the mage can summon. Each time this power is taken, two more minor forms can be chosen. 

PCs can select four powers at chargen for free, as part of the arcane background.
