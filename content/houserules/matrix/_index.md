My v1.0 Matrix houserules are based on a backport of most of the new ideas from Shadowrun 6e to 5e, while maintaining as much of the original system as possible. These are (hopefully) going to be replaced by the other Matrix rules presented here. These rules are also canonical for my currently campaign. For now, you can [read my backport rules here](/archive/matrix_backport/).

The rest of this section represents an early draft of my v2.0 houserules, which further builds on the backport to streamline some areas.
