[Savage Worlds](https://www.peginc.com/product-category/savage-worlds/) ($10 PDF, $40 hardback) is a generic RPG engine which has numerous supplements and rulesets in all sorts of genres, from the high fantasy of Savage Pathfinder to the Weird West of Deadlands and the post-apocalyptic The After. But no matter the setting, Savage World prides itself on always being _Fast, Furious, and Fun!_ 

If you want a quick five-minute overview of the core mechanics of Savage Worlds, [this cartoon is excellent](https://www.uptofourplayers.com/ready-to-roll/savage-worlds-rules/).

Savage Worlds has many characteristics that make it a good fit for playing Shadowrun:

* It's a classless system
* Its rules are (much!) sleeker than Shadowrun's, but it still has plenty of tactical depth to combat (in the distant past, Savage Worlds was descended from a tactical mintatures wargame.)
* It has rich character creation, with a large array of unique abilities to choose from.

It's worth noting there are some characteristics that make it not to everyone's tastes, however:

* Less predictable dice rolls - as it (typically) rolls two dice and chooses the highest the results can swing from failure to dramatic success more freely than Shadowrun's dice pool system. 
* ...more...?

Savage Worlds been a popular choice for playing Shadowrun via various fan-made hacks for many years. I'm going to mention two specific options based on more polished commercial releases.

## Sprawlrunners

Weighing in at a svelte 71 pages, [Sprawlrunners](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/334278) ($7 PDF, $25-35 POD) is the all-killer-no-filler Shadowrun ruleset you need.

{{% alert title="Bias Alert" %}}I moved my in-progress Shadowrun campaign to Sprawlrunners a couple of years ago and have been very happy with the result. In the rest of this document I have attempted to remain neutral but here I abandon all claims to objectivity; I really like Sprawlrunners.{{% /alert %}}

### What you get

Sprawlrunners takes the core Savage Worlds rules and adds everything you need to play in a "classic era" Shadowrun 2050s setting, including:

* Rules for cyberware 
* Physical adepts
* Two arcane traditions - hermetic mages and shamans
* Gear listings
* Decking (via wired connections and VR only)
* Riggers (including a variety of drones)

### Some things to know

Sprawlrunners has some innovative game mechanics that are worth understanding before you dive in.

Firstly: there is no money in the game. Long time Shadowrun GMs know the difficult balancing act of there essentially being two different character improvement 'currencies' (nuyen and karma) that different archetypes need in unequal amounts (mages need more karma, streetsams need more nuyen.) As these rewards are typically handed out evenly, this can be tricky to balance.

Sprawlrunners deals with this by removing money as a tracked resource. Instead, character advancement - whether it is a mage learning new spells or a streetsam getting some new cyberware - is all tied to the Savage Worlds 'advances' game mechanic (essentially, levelling up.) All permanent gear like cyberware, magic inititaion, or foci are handled through this single mechanic.

Gear, vehicles, cyberdecks, drones, and similar are handled via a parallel mechanic called _logistic points_. These represent a combination of the character's cash-on-hand and their contact network; their access to fixers, weapon dealers, and so forth. Logistic points are a renewable resource. The assumption is that all the gear used during a mission is discarded afterward and replaced before the next mission. This aligns the game mechanics with the tropes of heist movies, where gear is typically ephemeral and tailored to the mission at hand.

All gear purchasing is handed with **Logistics Points** rather than money.

## Interface Zero

If you prefer a crunchier approach, another option for using Savage Worlds to play Shadowrun is the cyberpunk setting [Interface Zero 3.0](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/288734/Interface-Zero-30-Players-Guide-to-2095) ($20)/. Unlike Sprawlrunners, IZ has more of a maximalist take on gear, with a very large selection of weapons, cyberware, etc. Take those two, and add on [this (free) fan-made hack](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/fcho08/shadowrun_conversion_for_interface_zero_30/) (which cleverly uses pre-existing Savage World rules for fantasy elements like magic and metahumans) and you get yourself a pretty neat Shadowrun system.
