By default, Sprawlrunners presents a classic '80s cyberpunk take on cyberspace: wired decks and VR hacking. Since 4e, Shadowrun has moved away from this, blending in modern technologies like cellphones and wifi. People have different opinions about how good an idea this is, but I quite like it, so below are some houserules aimed at putting wireless devices and hacking into Sprawlrunners - while hopefully keeping it _Fast! Furious! And Fun!_

*NB I will use Shadowrun-speak in this section ie "decker" not "operator", "host" not "system."*

If you're reading these rules for the first time, you might like to start with [this overview]({{< relref "setting/matrix/overview.md" >}}), which sets out the key concepts and how they fit together. The rest of this section is dedicated to the rules mechanics for applying these houserules to Sprawlrunners. [The Matrix section in the Settings part of the site]({{< relref "setting/matrix/" >}}) provides an in-world explanation of the Matrix and how it functions.
