xxx blah write some intro xxx

Note thar Heat and Hunted generally (but not always) apply to the team as a whole rather than individual members. 

## Heat {#heat}

If your last mission attracted a bit more attention than was strictly warranted - and if that attention is at least vaguely directed in your direction, eg. if you left clear imagery on CCTV or some DNA behind - then you might suffer from Heat. Heat isn't 

As a general rule, Heat will only come about when the story demands it, and will be clearly (and explicitly) foreshadowed. Most shadowrun targets either won't waste time in zero-sum reprisals against the team that hit them; the ones that will take it personally don't have the resources to make your life difficult. 

Still, they might rattle some cages, put out the word on the street that they're out for your blood (even if it is a bluff). In return, some of your usual contacts might refuse to deal with you until the heat blows over, for fear of becoming collateral damage.

Heat is represented by a die type (d4-d12) that opposes any roll you make during Downtime. This models that every part of your illegal existence gets that little bit harder when you're second-guessing which of your contacts might sell you out for two grand and a Stuffer Shack burrito. 

- d4 for a large and powerful street gang, organised crime lieutenants, a single policlub branch, or any other organisation with fewer than two dozen people to call on. 
- d6 for local city-wide police, a gang with multiple chapters in one country
- d8 for a Mafia capo, an A-grade corp, the feds, a gang with international chapters
- d12 for a large chunk (think global division) of an AAA megacorp, if you somehow mess up that bad (don't mess up that bad.)

On any Downtime action where the Heat die beats you, the action is nullified - whatever you attempted didn't work out (a contact didn't come through, you were unable to get supplies, someone tried to rat you out and you had to walk away, etc.) There are no other ill-effects though. 

If you roll a critical fail, expect to either "upgrade" to Hunted or for there to be consequences during the next mission! Probably at a really inconvenient time too.

Heat can be reduced or removed by using the Lie Low [Downtime action]({{< relref "downtime.md" >}}). 

## Hunted {#hunted}

Hunted is like Heat, but now it's personal. You haven't vaguely annoyed some organisation bigger than you this time, like a mosquito buzzing around a cow. Hunted is when you stung a lion, and now the lion is pissed, and also some corp mad scientist grafted a flamethrower onto it for some reason. 

Hunted has the same dice tiers as Heat, based on the resources that your hunter can muster up, but now it adds a Wild Die. 

If you fail an opposed roll during Downtime, you're probably going to be found. If you get a critical fail, you're probably going to walk into an ambush, unless I can think of something worse / more devious. 

Hunted can be reduced or removed by using the Lie Low [Downtime action]({{< relref "downtime.md" >}}). 

Hunted should only arise as a result of clear and direct story action where you enrage a powerful NPC who knows exactly who you are.
