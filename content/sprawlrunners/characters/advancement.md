Core SWADE has a simple structure for advancement: every so often, the character earns an *advance*. Each advance can be spend on a few things, such as improving traits or new Edges. Every three advances, the character also improves their *rank*, which unlocks new Edges and other abilities. Sprawlrunners doesn't change this structure.

Advances are quite "large", as it were. Each one is quite a significant power boost for a character. It's slightly tricky to work out at what rate to hand them out, as our mission length varies quite a lot and our sessions are quite short.

For my campaign, to smooth over this, I'm going to make a small change, and re-introduce karma from Shadowrun. Karma will be simply spent on advances at a straight 10:1 ratio (ie. one advance costs 10 karma.) This means I can have a slightly more granular mechanic to reward you than just SWADE advances, but it doesn't change any game balance.

## Mission rewards

There are two rewards characters will earn from a mission: karma and nuyen.

I'll typically award karma at a rate of 3-5 per session, depending on how much you get done, and also give out occasional bonus points for cool writeups of downtime actions and stuff like that. (Note: at-the-table cool stuff, like clever strategies, funny jokes, and excellent roleplaying will earn Bennies, not karma. This is to your advantage; Bennies are powerful.)

Nuyen will be negotiated in-game by your characters, as usual. Nuyen is used to cover your lifestyle costs for a while after the mission ends, during which time you can do some downtime actions; see [downtime]({{< relref "downtime.md" >}}) for details. The more nuyen you earn, the more downtime you get.

Note that *nuyen cannot be spent as a replacement for Logistic Points*. See [wealth]({{< relref "wealth.md" >}}) for more information.
