There is a character generation tool for Savage Worlds at [savaged.us](https://savaged.us/). It's free, and has support for Sprawlrunners, but there's a few non-obvious things to getting the best from it.

NB: the chargen quick reference in the SWADE CRB, pages 55-63, are very good and are recommended reading. Remember that the Sprawlrunners book adds extra options on top of those, though.

## Getting started 

You can only access the Sprawlrunners tools in savaged.us if you register for the site. So do that. Note that it has a bit of a habit of logging you out unexpectedly - keep an eye on that (if it does log you out, it'll have a Login prompt at the top right.)

Once you do that, select Characters in the left toolbar (1), then the New Character icon at the bottom right (2), then select Sprawlrunners from the list of settings (3). This will pre-load some rules customisations.

## Notes on each step

Once you've done the above, you'll get a series of tabs you step through in order (more or less) to create your character.

### Character concept

Most of this is completely optional but selecting your native language is helpful later. All characters speak two languages by default: your mother tongue (English, Japanese, German, etc) and "Sprawlspeak", a pidgin commonly used on the streets of metroplexes. If you want more, take the Linguist edge.

Don't worry about adding Sprawlspeak to your character sheet at this point. There's no way to do it that won't cost you points. We'll take care of that during play.

### Awakened characters

To play a **mage, shaman, or physical adept** character, skip ahead to Edges and add "Arcane Background", then come back. This will unlock other options you want to take.

### Hindrances

Remember you are restricted to no more than 4 points of hindrances, where a Minor hindrance is worth 1 point and a Major hindrance is worth 2 points. When you're done, select "Add an Edge" in the "Perks" box in the left column to spend the points you got for the hindrances.

For descriptions of the Hindrances, see the SWADE CRB and the Sprawlrunners book. You also get a one-line summary within savaged.us when you add them to your character.

### Traits

Keep in mind it costs more points to raise a skill to a die type higher than the linked attribute. For example, if you have Agility at d6, it costs 1 skill point to take Shooting to d6, then 2 more skill points to take it to d8.

Note that some skills you get for free at the basic, d4 level: athletics, stealth, common knowledge, notice, and persuasion. For any other skill you don't take, you will roll (d4-2).

Some notes about specific skills:
  
* **Fighting** is all melee combat; **Shooting** is all guns; **Athletics** is all throwing weapons (including grenades).
* **Occult** is used for theoretical knowledge of magic (can be taken by non-magical characters.) It's similar to Arcane in Shadowrun.
* **Spellcasting** is used for all magical actions, including summoning spirits.
* **Driving** is all ground vehicles and drones, **Piloting** is all aircraft, **Boating** is all aquatic vehicles.
* **Persuasion** is your go-to "lie convincingly" skill.
* **Notice** is your perception skill.

### Guns, vehicles, and other gear

Sprawlrunners uses an innovative system for gear where you do not purchase it at character generation. Instead, your character has Logistics Points (LPs), representing their cash on hand, contacts, and trustworthiness. You "spend" these points during play to acquire gear you need for the mission, then discard the gear later so you can't be traced or tracked through it. This gear is off-the-books; your contacts have taken the time to scrub it clean of any identifying or traceable marks, and it comes complete with fake licences where appropriate.

You can use LPs to buy stuff in chargen if you want, just to get a feel for what it costs, but you're not committed to those purchases.

If you want more LPs, look at the Rich or Filthy Rich edges. You will also earn more as your character advances.

### Special gear: cyberware, foci, signature weapons

Items your character owns permanently, like cyberware or magical foci, works differently. You choose an Edge and get the gear, forever, without spending LPs.

To get cyberware, take the Chromed, Man And Machine, and/or More Machine Than Man edges. Each of these gives you 2 Implant Points to spend on cyberware. Note that (for technical reasons) the cyberware part of savaged.us lists the "cost" of cyberware as Logistic Points, but this is incorrect, they're actually Implant Points.

Some common/small cyberware doesn't cost any Implant Points. To get these, you have to take the Implanted edge. You can take any amount of zero-rated cyberware once you take the Implanted edge once.

### Adept powers

Adept powers work similarly to Implant Points. You get Chi Points with your Arcane Background edge, and more via other edges. Then you spend those points on powers.
