## Spirit chargen rules

For the main, these will follow the rules in the Savage Worlds [Summoner's Circle](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/273484) supplement.

Each greatform at each power level has some pre-defined stats that cannot be altered; the player is then free to spend the rest of the build points (per the Summoner's Circle system) to customise them and create the minor form they will summon.

(I haven't created those statblocks yet. We'll fill them in as we need them, and I will document them here as we go along.)

### Common powers

All spirits have the following powers and abilities. Numbers in brackets are the points value from Summoner's Circle.

* -4 damage to mundane ranged attacks (2): difficult to harm with physical objects alone.
* Dual-natured (1): native to the astral plane; is always astrally perceiving at all times.
* Elemental (5): doesn't need to eat or breathe; immune to poison/disease; immune to called shots; ignores 1 level of Wound penalties.
* Extraplanar (-2): can be targeted by the Banish power.
* Fearless (2): immune to fear effects.

### Elementals

Earth, air, fire, and water also each have special minor forms called "elementals", which match up to the boring stereotypes used by dreary hermetic mages. There is no such thing as elementals of beasts or man, though.

Elementals are different from other spirits; they are plodding, incurious about the world around them, less likely to bear grudges if abused by their summoner.

Elementals use the statblocks from Sprawlrunners RAW.

### Servants / watchers

Rules as per Sprawlrunners RAW.
