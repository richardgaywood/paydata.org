For avoidance of doubt, here's all the houserules that are in use in our current campaign:

* [Downtime]({{< relref "houserules/characters/downtime.md" >}}) and [Contacts]({{< relref "contacts.md" >}}) are a linked set of rules that cover what you character can get done between missions, and how they can earn their contact's favours for the future.
* [Simplified skills](/houserules/characters/skills) slightly reduces the overall skill count in SR5e and makes some changes to skill groups to make life a little easier for archetypes like deckers and riggers.
* My [streamlined action economy]({{< relref "houserules/action_economy/basics.md" >}}) changes initative tracking, eliminates multiple passes, and gives streetsams and physads a powerful new multi-attack option.
* For magicians there are houserules for [summoning]({{< relref "houserules/magic/summoning.md" >}}), [foci]({{< relref "foci.md" >}}) and [initiation]({{< relref "initiation.md" >}}). I've also added a new capability to create [trinkets]({{< relref "reagents.md" >}}) from reagents.
* Gear houserules:
  * Electronics houserules reduce the price of cyberdecks
  * [Drugs]({{< relref "drugs.md" >}}) removes psyche, which is painfully OP for magicians.
