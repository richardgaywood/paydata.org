Basic idea: similar to cyberdecks, but cheaper. Several tiers with different LP costs. Each tier can load a different number of modules.

Modules

* Extended s-PAN range for drones only: 1km -> 10km
* Stealth: can hide s-PAN
* Drone hacking: as Persuasion utility, but only works against drones 
* Firewall: adds cyberspace parry as per Fighting utility (2 + 1/2 Hacking)
* Pilot: add wild die to drone piloting rolls 
* Gunnery: adds wild die to drone ranged attacks
