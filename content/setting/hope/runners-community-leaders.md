Consider your Shadowrunners. They probably live in a pretty low-end area; not quite a squatter-riddled slum, but not a _nice_ part of town either. Even if they do have a quiet apartment in a glittering wageslave tower, they probably don't live their lives or ply their trades in the bars and restaurants beneath it. Those are for more conventional people. Our beloved heroes and antiheroes tend to be a bit too... outr√©. Pink mohawks stand out in wine lodges and whisky lounges.

No; regardless of where their bed is, most Shadowrunners live their lives around the edges of polite society, in the crumbling, forgotten places, out of sight for the wageslave masses. They grow up there. Their friends are there. Their contacts are there. This is where they go to find work, sell paydata, hustle for payouts. 

## The street is made up of predators and prey...

...and sometimes you're both at once.
